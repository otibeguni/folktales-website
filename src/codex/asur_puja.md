# Asur Worship and Cultural Traditions

The **Asur** community of India, primarily residing in Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha, and adjoining regions, maintain a distinct set of cultural beliefs and rituals centered around their ancestral legends, agricultural cycles, and resistance to mainstream Vedic narratives. Their traditions include unique festivals, dances, songs, and a strong collective memory of their ancestral king **Hudur Durga**, whom they commemorate during the pan-Indian **Durga Puja** in an oppositional manner.

## Origins and Migration Myth

According to Asur oral traditions, their ancestral land was **Hihiri Pipiri** in Africa, where their forebears **Pilchu Haram** and **Pilchu Burhi** lived. Believed to have been born from a bird (or "kher"), they were the progenitors of the **Kherwal** clan. Their marriage, arranged by the deity **Marang Buru**, led to the birth of seven sons and seven daughters, who intermarried and further expanded the community.

As the population increased, space in Hihiri Pipiri became scarce. The Kherwals migrated through regions such as **Khajkaman**, **Harataburu**, **Sasangbeda**, **Jarpi Desh**, **Aire Desh**, and **Chai Desh**, finally settling in **Champa**, where they established what is referred to as the **original Sindhu (Indus) civilization**. Linguistic and cultural evidence in their songs suggest migration routes through **Iran** and **Kandahar** into the Indian subcontinent.

## The Legend of Hudur Durga

In Champa, the Kherwals lived peacefully under the governance of various clans:

* **Kisku** (ruling class),
* **Baskey** (merchants),
* **Turus** (musicians and blacksmiths),
* **Beshra** (dancers).

Their harmony was disrupted by an invasion from the **Aryan (Debanshi) deities**, leading to a legendary war that the Asurs equate with the mythological **Deva–Asura** conflict. Their king, **Hudur Durga** ("Hudur" meaning brave, "Durga" meaning fortress protector), led a fierce resistance.

Unable to defeat him in battle, the Aryans sent a woman named **Durga** as part of a ploy. Hudur Durga, who would not raise arms against a woman, laid down his weapons and was slain. The Aryans then established **Ardhabarta** in Champa. The remaining Kherwals, advised by **Bhuian Guru**, escaped in disguise, using a magical musical bow (*Bhuang*) to mislead the enemy, performing music and dance dressed as women.

## Dukh Dishai Parab

The **Sharadiya Durga Puja**, widely celebrated across India, is observed by the Asurs as a period of **mourning** for Hudur Durga’s martyrdom, known as the **Dukh Dishai Parab** ("Festival of Sorrow"). Formerly known as **Sukh Dishai Parab** during peaceful times, it is now an annual ritual of grief and remembrance.

During this time, Asur men wear female attire, including saris, blouses, and jewelry, along with **peacock feather headgear**, and perform the **Bhuang Dance** using traditional instruments. They collect alms door-to-door while singing mournful songs but do not consume the food inside their homes. The community feast held on **Dashami** marks the conclusion of the observance.

## Worship and Ritual Practices

### Jaher Than

Worship is often conducted at sacred groves or under a **Sal tree**, known as **Jaher Than**, typically marked by a vermilion-smeared stone. Ritual dances and songs are performed, and symbolic offerings made.

### Sohrai Festival

In **Jharkhand**, the **Sohrai Festival**, held during **Kali Puja**, commemorates Mahishasur's death. Oil is applied to the chest, navel, and nose—symbolic of the sites of his fatal wounds. The **Santhal** variant of this festival, also known as **Saharai**, emphasizes cattle and harvest prosperity and is celebrated across Bengal, Jharkhand, and Odisha.

Saharai festivities last five days:

* First two days involve ritual worship led by village heads (*Jagas* and *Majhis*).
* The following days are filled with communal drinking (*haria*), dancing, and feasting.
* Chickens are sacrificed, and the meat is used to prepare ritual **khichuri**.

### Associated Legends

Several folk tales parallel Asur themes:

* In one, **Adur**, the Asur king of Santhal Raj, is deceived by a woman sent by **Indra** who marries him and leaks his secrets, leading to his downfall.
* In a **Mundari** tale, a wild buffalo raises a girl as its daughter, who is later pursued by a king. The buffalo dies trying to protect her.

## Hudur Durga Worship

In **Kendasol**, **West Medinipur**, the community worships a muscular idol of **Hudur Durga**, with a short dhoti, bow (*Bhuang*), and arrows. Worshippers do not create or honor Goddess Durga idols. In **Nirail**, only Asur community members are allowed to participate in Hudur Durga worship.

## Regional Practices

### Northern Bengal (Malbazar Region)

In **Caroline Tea Garden** near Bhutan border, about 105 Asur families avoid Durga worship. Instead, they offer **blood sacrifices** to a clay mound during the Puja days, but it remains unclear whether this is **ancestor worship** or an alternative **Asur Puja**.

### Agricultural Rites

The Asurs practice numerous seasonal agrarian rituals:

* **Naokhani** and **Hariyali Puja** (Ashwin): Offerings include red chickens, maize, red spinach, and rice beer. No priesthood exists—elders or household heads officiate.
* **Govardhan Puja**: A mango branch is planted and decorated as the deity. Sacrifices and khichuri offerings follow.
* **Bongari or Dhatrima Puja** (Shravan): Performed on sowing day with saplings placed on field ridges.
* **Bhag Puja and Khaliyan Puja**: Conducted during harvest; includes offerings of eggs, chickens, and grain.

### Holi (Phagua)

Asurs celebrate **Holi** by planting and worshipping a **three-headed shimul branch**, followed by animal sacrifices. Women are excluded from rituals and prasad distribution.

## Sharana Puja

**Sharana Puja**, held in April–May (Boishakh–Jaistha), is one of the rare occasions where Asurs invoke **Vedic deities** like **Shiva**, **Surya**, and **Kali**—perhaps as an ecological ritual to induce rain. It involves:

* Worship of the **Sal tree** (or substitute species like Gokul, Moyna, etc.)
* Seven red flags planted around the tree
* Offerings of animal blood and **bhang** (cannabis)

Notably, Kali in this context is the same goddess who, in Asur mythology, is believed to have slain their ancestor Hudur Durga by deceit.
