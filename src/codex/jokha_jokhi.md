# **Jakha and Jakhi**

**Jakha** (Bengali: যখা) and **Jakhi** (Bengali: যখি) are local folk deities worshipped in parts of North Bengal, especially in districts such as Cooch Behar, Tufanganj, Mathabhanga, and Dinhata. They are often considered benevolent protectors of children but can also appear as malevolent spirits if not properly appeased. While typically classified as **opodevata** (subordinate deities or spirits), they are deeply embedded within the local religious and ritualistic traditions of the region.

## **Origins and Association with Masan and Kubera**

The worship of Jakha and Jakhi is closely associated with the cult of **Masan Thakur**, a group of local deities believed to originate from goddess Kali’s perspiration during ecstatic dance. The name **Jakha** is derived from the Sanskrit **Yaksha**, another name for Kubera, the Hindu god of wealth. In certain traditions, Jakha is seen as a localized, folk version of Kubera. Because of this, Jakha and Jakhi are sometimes regarded as alternative manifestations of Masan deities or even folk representations of Lord Shiva.

## **Iconography and Symbolism**

The idols of Jakha and Jakhi are typically crafted from **sholapith** (Indian cork) and painted black. They are often installed as paired figures representing husband and wife. The image of Jakha usually depicts a meditative, seated posture (padmasana), with serpents coiled around his upraised arms and flowing matted hair (jata) adorning his head.

These deities are viewed both as protective and temperamental. Devotees believe that Jakha and Jakhi must be respected—those who pass their shrines without proper reverence may fall ill or suffer misfortune due to the deities’ displeasure.

## **Rituals and Worship**

Jakha-Jakhi puja is generally observed in the **month of Phalgun** (February–March). The puja is often performed to protect children from illness or misfortune believed to be caused by these spirits. Specific rituals involve:

* **Animal sacrifices**, such as goats (patha) and pigeons (pāyra), whose meat is later consumed as prasad.
* **Offerings of curd** (doi), as it is considered especially dear to these deities. When a cow gives milk for the first time, curd made from that milk is offered to Jakha and Jakhi.
* **Protective amulets** (maduli) tied around children’s wrists by a **Ojha** (traditional healer or folk priest), especially when a child is thought to be afflicted by the deities.

In cases of childhood illnesses believed to be caused by Jakha-Jakhi (such as frequent miscarriages, stillbirths, or unexplained fevers), the affected child is rolled on the ground in front of the deities' shrine (than), and then smeared with **consecrated soil**. This soil, considered imbued with healing powers, may also be consumed as part of the ritual.

## **Cultural Significance and Belief Systems**

Despite being considered "subordinate" spirits, Jakha and Jakhi occupy a unique place in the religious landscape of North Bengal. They are feared, venerated, and lovingly placated by communities who see them both as protectors and as beings prone to anger if neglected. Their shrines, known as **than**, may range from simple altars under sacred trees to more elaborate village temples.

The belief system around Jakha-Jakhi illustrates the blending of classical Hindu elements (such as Yaksha and Kubera) with localized folk traditions and animistic practices. These traditions continue to persist today in rural areas, forming an essential part of Bengal's rich and complex religious culture.
