# Makal Thakur

**Makal Thakur** is a folk deity worshipped primarily by fishing communities in the North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, particularly in the Bheri region. The deity is associated with protection and success in fishing and fish farming activities.

## Origin and Iconography

The idol of Makal Thakur is traditionally made from sticky clay collected from riverbanks. The clay is molded with fingers to form a rough face featuring eyes and a nose, in a style reminiscent of Kushan-period statues.

In most places, the deity is worshipped as a clay idol placed on a clay altar. However, in one location near Sonapukur, along the route from Shiyaldah to Basanti via Ghatakpukur, the deity is represented by a **mound-shaped head idol** (*munda murti*). This head idol has distinctive features:

* Long, flowing hair resembling that of a demon
* Prominent eyes
* Large earrings
* A neck ornament (gala pati)

This unique idol style sets Makal Thakur apart from other folk deities.

## Worship Practices

* The fishing communities begin worshipping Makal Thakur at the start of the fishing season and continue until its end.
* Offerings are made in the form of clay lumps or a mound of earth known as *bataasa* (a type of sweet), presented respectfully to the deity.
* A lamp (*bichali*) is lit at the shrine during the night.
* The worship is a rural folk ritual primarily practiced in North 24 Parganas, whereas the southern parts of the district have different local deities and festivals.
