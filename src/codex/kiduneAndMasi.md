# Kidune and Masi Worship in the Rarh Region of West Bengal

In the Rarh region of West Bengal, particularly in Bardhaman and surrounding areas, folk deities **Kidune** (associated with Kadumshini) and **Masi** are worshipped as protectors of children. These practices are deeply rooted in local beliefs addressing the well-being of infants and the community. **Kidune Pukur** (Crying Ponds) are sacred sites where ritual baths are believed to stop incessant crying in children, while **Masi** is revered as a formidable goddess with a historical association with human sacrifice. Both traditions reflect the region’s rich folk religious landscape, blending agrarian concerns with spiritual remedies.

## Kidune (Kadumshini) Worship
**Kidune** refers to a folk belief centered around ponds known as **Kidune Pukur**, where parents bring children who cry uncontrollably for a ritual bath to alleviate their distress. In some areas, these ponds are associated with the worship of **Kadumshini**, a deity believed to calm such children.

- **Ritual Practices**:
  - **Kidune Pukur**: These ponds are scattered across the Rarh region and are considered sacred for their ability to stop incessant crying in children. Parents bathe their children in the pond, believing the ritual will pacify them.
  - **Kadumshini Puja**: In some locations, Kadumshini is worshipped at the site of Kidune Pukur, particularly on **Vijaya Dashami** (the tenth day of Durga Puja). The deity has no physical idol, and the puja is conducted through offerings and prayers at the pond or a designated site.
- **Cultural Significance**: The Kidune Pukur tradition reflects a practical solution to a common parental concern—uncontrollable crying in children—rooted in folk spirituality. The worship of Kadumshini, tied to the Durga Puja festival, underscores the integration of local beliefs with broader Hindu practices, emphasizing child welfare through divine intervention.

## Masi Worship
**Masi** is a fearsome child-protecting goddess worshipped in villages like Gobardhanpur, Kayrapur, and Uddharanpur in the Bardhaman region. Historically, Masi’s shrine was associated with human sacrifice, a practice that has been discontinued.

- **Ritual Practices**:
  - **Annual Puja**: The primary worship of Masi occurs annually, with rituals centered around her *than* (shrine). After the puja in Gobardhanpur, Masi’s ritual basket (*jhapi*) is ceremonially taken to Kshirgram for the annual puja of **Yogadya**, another regional deity, indicating a connection between local worship practices.
  - **Offerings and Modern Practices**: While specific offerings are not detailed in the available accounts, the puja likely involves traditional items like vermilion, rice, and sweets, common in folk worship. The cessation of human sacrifice marks a shift toward less extreme rituals, aligning with modern sensibilities.
- **Cultural Significance**: Masi’s fearsome reputation reflects her role as a protective yet potentially vengeful deity, safeguarding children but demanding proper worship. The transportation of her ritual basket to Kshirgram highlights regional networks of folk worship, linking Masi to other deities like Yogadya. The historical mention of human sacrifice underscores the intensity of past beliefs, now softened by contemporary practices.

## Cultural and Social Context
The worship of Kidune (Kadumshini) and Masi reflects the Rarh region’s agrarian and community-driven religious traditions. These practices address specific concerns—children’s health and protection—through localized rituals that blend Hindu and folk elements. The absence of idols in Kadumshini’s worship and the historical shift away from human sacrifice in Masi’s rituals illustrate the adaptability of folk religion to social changes. The connection between Masi’s puja and Yogadya’s worship in Kshirgram suggests a regional ritual ecosystem, where deities and their practices are interlinked across villages. These traditions underscore the role of folk deities in providing spiritual solutions to everyday challenges, particularly for rural families.

## Comparison with Other Folk Deities
Kidune and Masi share similarities with other regional folk deities like **Mahangiri**, **Minha Samni**, and **Enthu Thakur**, where non-traditional worship sites (ponds, walls, or stones) replace idols. However, Kidune’s association with ponds and Masi’s historical link to human sacrifice distinguish them. Kadumshini’s puja during Vijaya Dashami aligns with mainstream Hindu festivals, while Masi’s fearsome nature and ritual basket transfer highlight her unique role in the local pantheon.
