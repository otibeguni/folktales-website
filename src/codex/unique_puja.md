# Unique Durga Puja Traditions in West Bengal

Durga Puja, a major Hindu festival celebrating the worship of Goddess Durga, is observed with diverse and distinctive traditions across West Bengal. This article explores three unique Durga Puja practices—Neel Durga, Kanak Durga, and Bhandani Puja—each characterized by distinct rituals, historical significance, and local legends.

## Neel Durga Puja

### Overview
The **Neel Durga Puja** is a distinctive Durga Puja held in Nazia Para, Krishnanagar, Nadia district, West Bengal. The defining feature of this puja is the blue-colored idol of Goddess Durga, known as **Neel Durga** (Blue Durga), which sets it apart from traditional depictions of the goddess.

### Origin and Legend
According to local lore, an artisan named Pal mistakenly painted the Durga idol blue during its creation. Despite multiple attempts, the blue color could not be removed. Subsequently, a divine command received in a dream instructed that the Durga idol for this puja should henceforth be painted blue. This tradition has been followed ever since, making the Neel Durga a unique symbol of the Nazia Para puja.

### Rituals
The Neel Durga Puja includes several distinctive rituals:
- **Navami Sacrifice**: On Navami (the ninth day), a clay effigy representing an enemy is placed outside. A male member of the household sacrifices it with a sword without looking back. The sword is then washed, and the water is sprinkled on all attendees and throughout the house.
- **Dashami Rituals**: On Dashami (the tenth day), before the idol’s immersion, a Ganesha Puja and a yajna (fire ritual) are performed. The ash from the yajna is applied as a tilak (mark) on everyone’s forehead in a ritual called **Prashasti Bandhan**.
- **Prasad**: The prasad distributed on Dashami includes fermented rice (panta bhat), taro leaves (kochu shak), and fried lentil fritters (bora bhaja).

### Sen Family Tradition
In the Sen family’s Neel Durga Puja, led by Narayan Chandra Sen, the idol of Durga is worshipped without the demon Mahishasura, a departure from the traditional depiction of Durga slaying the demon. This demon-less Durga worship is a hallmark of the Sen family and is also observed in other puja traditions in the Rarh region and North Bengal’s Bhagdani Puja.

## Kanak Durga Puja

### Overview
The **Kanak Durga Puja** is celebrated in Chikligarh, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, where Goddess Durga is worshipped as **Kanak Durga** (Golden Durga). The deity is depicted as a four-armed goddess riding a horse, distinct from the traditional lion or tiger mount.

### Origin and Legend
According to tradition, the king of Chikligarh received a divine vision in which Goddess Durga appeared and instructed him to worship her as Kanak Durga. She specified that her idol should be four-armed, holding a skull, a gesture of boon-giving, reins, and a sword, with a horse as her mount and clad in blue attire (Neelambari). Following this command, the king crafted the idol using golden bangles from the queens.

### Historical Practices
In ancient times, the Kanak Durga Puja was associated with human sacrifice, known as **Nisha Bali**, performed on Ashtami (the eighth day). Victims were sacrificed outside the temple, and parts of their flesh and blood were sprinkled around a nearby underground well. The body was then buried, accompanied by prayers for forgiveness. This practice was halted after an incident where a Brahmin boy, intended for sacrifice, began chanting Durga mantras. Queen Gobindamani intervened, stopping the sacrifice, and human sacrifice was banned thereafter. It was replaced by the **Biram Bhog** ritual.

### Biram Bhog Ritual
The Biram Bhog is a unique ritual introduced as an alternative to human sacrifice. A large clay pot is filled with meat, one kilogram of ghee, spices, and salt, then covered with sal leaves and tied with rope. The pot is placed on a fire, and priests chant mantras while stirring the contents with a ladle. The ladle is left in the pot, and the room is locked. The next day, before the Navami puja, the pot is opened to reveal perfectly cooked meat, believed to be prepared by Kanak Durga herself.

## Bhandani Puja

### Overview
The **Bhandani Puja** is a unique post-Dashami Durga Puja tradition observed in North Bengal, particularly in Mekhliganj, Haldibari, and Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar. It is celebrated for three days following Dashami, often associated with a figure named Bhandani, linked to Goddess Durga.

### Legends and Origins
Two primary legends explain the origin of the Bhandani Puja:
1. **King Nahush’s Tale**: In ancient times, King Nahush forgot about the Durga Puja while hunting during the festival. On Dashami, when the idol was to be immersed, Durga refused to leave without the king’s offerings. Riding a tiger, she found him in the forest, where he offered his prayers and sought forgiveness. This incident is said to have initiated the Bhandani Puja tradition.
2. **Bhandani’s Illness**: Another narrative describes Bhandani as a companion of Durga who fell ill during their return to the heavens after Dashami. Durga stayed in a village for three days, during which the villagers worshipped her, leading to the establishment of the Bhandani Puja.
3. **Bhandani as Durga’s Sister**: A third story portrays Bhandani as Durga’s sister, who was saddened by her lack of worship compared to Durga. Durga advised her to appear on Earth on Ekadashi (the eleventh day). Bhandani followed this advice, and her worship for three days after Dashami became the Bhandani Puja.

### Rituals
The Bhandani Puja is observed for three consecutive days starting from Ekadashi, with rituals focused on honoring Bhandani and, by extension, Durga. The puja reinforces community participation and devotion in North Bengal.

## Cultural Significance
These unique Durga Puja traditions—Neel Durga, Kanak Durga, and Bhandani Puja—highlight the diversity of worship practices in West Bengal. Each puja is steeped in local folklore, divine interventions, and distinct rituals that reflect the region’s rich cultural and religious heritage. These practices continue to attract devotees and visitors, preserving the spiritual and historical legacy of the communities that observe them.
