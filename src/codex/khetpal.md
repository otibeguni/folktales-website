# Khetpal

**Khetpal** is a traditional folk deity revered in the Rarh region of West Bengal, India. Known as a guardian or protector deity, Khetpal holds a significant place in local rural spiritual practices, especially among lower caste communities.

## Origin and Identity

According to a verse from *Nuktikarnamrita*:

> *“তৈস্তজীরোপ হারৈ গিরি কুরে শিলা সংশরয়ামর্চযিত্বা,
> দেবীং কান্তার দুর্গ রুধির মুপতরু ক্ষেত্রপালায় দত্বা।।”*

This verse suggests that Khetpal is an ancient folk deity native to the Rarh region. He is worshipped as a protector of fields and rural households.

## Worship and Cultural Significance

Khetpal’s shrines, known locally as *thans*, are found in places like Katwa, Mangalkot, and Ketugri. Unlike mainstream Hindu deities, Khetpal is not worshipped through idol rituals; instead, his worship centers around a site marked by a trishul (trident) wrapped in a red cloth.

The worship practices are deeply tied to the local agrarian lifestyle. Khetpal is often worshipped with a focus on appeasing him through offerings rather than elaborate ceremonies.

## Rituals and Beliefs

* Khetpal is typically honored with a red gamcha (a traditional cloth).
* His worship usually takes place just after the festival of *Nabami*.
* In some villages like Nigana, Khetpal is worshipped on Poila Boishakh (Bengali New Year).
* During his worship in Nigana, drumming announces the cooking of offerings, and villagers are instructed to remain indoors.
* An offering of khichuri (a rice and lentil dish) is made before Khetpal, and live catfish (sholmach) are placed in the pot while cooking. The fish must not move during cooking; after they die, the cooked fish is offered to Khetpal.
* Offerings are placed on banana leaves before the deity, and it is believed that if Khetpal is pleased, he consumes all the offerings; otherwise, not even ants will touch the food.
* There is a local myth that the tree under which Khetpal’s shrine stands has extensive roots and branches, and no one dares to break even a single branch. A story tells of a man who once tried to take a branch home but was afflicted with severe itching midway, forcing him to abandon the branch.

## Nature of the Deity

While Khetpal is mainly worshipped as a protector deity, opinions about his nature vary:

* Some regard him as an *apadevata* (malevolent or fierce deity).
* Others see him as a terrifying or formidable god.
* The presence of the trishul at his shrine signifies his association with Shiva worship.
