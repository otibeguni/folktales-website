# Subhembari and Munda Puja

**Subhembari** (Bengali: সুভেম্বরী) and **Munda Puja** represent unique forms of **Durga** worship in West Bengal, India, characterized by distinct iconography and rituals rooted in local legends and Tantric traditions. Subhembari, enshrined as a black stone altar, is worshipped as a manifestation of Durga, while Munda Puja involves venerating a head-only (munda) idol of the goddess, symbolizing her fierce and esoteric aspects. These practices, prevalent in regions like **Murshidabad**, **Bardhaman**, and **Bankura**, contrast with mainstream Durga Puja traditions, such as **Kathamiya Durga Puja** in Cooch Behar, and share thematic similarities with other regional cults like **Khepima** and **Petkati Durga**.

## Subhembari

### Etymology

The name **Subhembari** is derived from Sanskrit and Bengali roots, possibly linked to *su* (auspicious) and a reference to the goddess’s benevolent yet powerful nature. The mantra invoking her as **Durga, the remover of distress**, underscores her identity as a traditional yet localized form of the goddess.

### Iconography

Unlike conventional Durga idols featuring ten arms and companions like Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartik, Subhembari is represented by a **black stone altar**, devoid of anthropomorphic features. This abstract form aligns with ancient aniconic worship practices in Bengal, emphasizing the deity’s divine essence over physical representation.

### Mythology and Origin

According to tradition, **King Nayapala** of the **Pala dynasty** (8th–12th centuries CE) established the worship of Subhembari Devi in Murshidabad. The black stone altar, revered as the goddess, is believed to have been installed during his reign, reflecting the Pala era’s patronage of Hindu and Buddhist deities. The deity’s association with Durga is affirmed by the mantra recited at the start of her worship, which invokes her as the remover of distress.

### Ritual Practices

The primary worship of Subhembari occurs on **Navami**, with festivities extending to **Dashami**. Key rituals include:
- **Community Participation**: On Dashami, local **Scheduled Caste communities** honor the deity through traditional song and dance, reflecting the puja’s inclusive nature.
- **Offerings**: Pure, unadulterated milk is essential for the puja, used to prepare **kheer** (rice pudding), offered as bhog alongside **munui**, a local delicacy. The emphasis on pure milk underscores the deity’s sanctity.
- **Timing**: The puja aligns with the standard Durga Puja calendar, culminating in Navami and Dashami, but its focus on a stone altar distinguishes it from idol-centric worship.

### Cultural Significance

Subhembari’s worship highlights Murshidabad’s historical connection to the Pala dynasty and its syncretic religious landscape, where Hindu and Buddhist influences coexisted. The use of a black stone altar evokes ancient goddess cults, while the participation of Scheduled Caste communities underscores the puja’s social inclusivity, akin to the non-Brahmanical elements in Cooch Behar’s **Boro Debi Puja**.

## Munda Puja

### Etymology

The term **Munda Puja** derives from *munda* (head), referring to the worship of a **head-only idol** of Durga, symbolizing her severed head or facial features. This practice is distinct from other regional rituals, such as the Bara Puja or Makal Thakur’s Munda Puja, which have different mythological and ritualistic contexts.

### Iconography

The munda idol is a stark departure from traditional Durga iconography:
- **Form**: A head-only representation of Durga, excluding companions like Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartik, the lion, or the demon.
- **Variations**: In **Dignagar**, the idol is flanked by **Jaya and Vijaya**, with **Shiva (Mahadeva)** positioned above, and is sometimes identified as **Chinnamasta Ma**. In **Sonabidhi**, the idol’s face is never painted, preserving its raw, Tantric aesthetic.
- **Material**: Idols may be crafted from clay, stone, or other materials, with some, like in Sonabidhi, buried and reused annually.

### Mythology and Legends

#### Gomai, Bardhaman

Around 300 years ago, in **Gomai village**, Bardhaman, a man named **Ray** encountered a beautiful woman bathing in a pond, submerged up to her neck. When their eyes met, she vanished. That night, she appeared in Ray’s dream, identifying herself as Durga and instructing him to worship the part of her body he had seen—her head. This led to the establishment of the **Munda Puja**, where only Durga’s head is worshipped, with immersion delayed until a **shankhachil (brahminy kite)** is sighted in the sky.

#### Beliator, Bankura

In **Beliator**, the **Ray family**, descendants of Bishnupur’s zamindars, faced a dilemma: their ancestral home housed an **ashtadhatu** idol of **Yashoreshwari Devi**. Fearing misfortune from creating another idol, they consulted pandits, who permitted the worship of a **head-only Durga idol**. This tradition, also practiced by the **Niyogi family** (Ray descendants), emphasizes Durga’s facial features, inspired by artist **Jamini Roy**’s symbolic representations.

#### Sonabidhi, Bankura

In **Sonabidhi**, two family members, **Nrisingha Lakshman** and **Gosingha Lakshman**, studied Tantra in **Kamrup**. At **Kamakhya**, Nrisingha mastered **Chandi Tantra** and initiated the Munda Puja upon returning. The idol’s unpainted face and annual burial in an earthen pot reflect its Tantric roots, distinguishing it from mainstream Durga worship.

#### Dignagar, Bardhaman

In **Dignagar**, the **Ray zamindar household** worships a **severed-head idol**, linked to two myths:
1. Durga showed her severed head to **Mahishasura** to confuse him before slaying him, inspiring the munda worship.
2. The idol represents **Chinnamasta**, whose severed head in Puranic texts symbolizes self-sacrifice and Tantric power. The idol, called **Chinnamasta Ma**, is flanked by Jaya and Vijaya.

The **Pal family** in Dignagar shifted from traditional seven-figurine Durga Puja to Munda Puja due to three myths:
1. Durga’s **Chamunda** form, assumed during her battle with Shumbha and Nishumbha, inspired the munda worship.
2. After **Thakurdas Pal**’s wife was forced into **sati**, a family member beheaded the Durga idol in rage, initiating the munda tradition.
3. Overcome by hunger, Durga consumed her own body, leaving only her head, prompting the Pal family, founded by **Raghunath Pal**, to worship her munda form.

### Ritual Practices

Munda Puja rituals vary by region but share core elements:
- **Gomai**: The head-only idol is worshipped from Saptami to Dashami, with immersion delayed until a shankhachil is sighted, symbolizing divine approval.
- **Sonabidhi**: The unpainted munda idol is worshipped, buried in an earthen pot after Dashami, and unearthed for the next year’s Saptami. Tantric rituals, influenced by Nrisingha Lakshman’s Chandi Tantra, are central.
- **Dignagar**: The munda idol, identified as Chinnamasta or Durga, is worshipped with Jaya and Vijaya, emphasizing her Tantric and martial aspects.
- **Offerings**: Traditional bhog, such as kheer and rice, is offered, with no documented animal sacrifices, unlike **Boro Debi**’s buffalo or **Kathamiya Durga**’s goat offerings.
- **Timing**: The puja follows the standard Durga Puja calendar (Saptami to Dashami), culminating in kalasha and idol immersion.

### Historical and Tantric Context

Munda Puja reflects Bengal’s **Tantric traditions**, particularly from the **Pala and Sena periods**, when fierce goddesses like **Chinnamasta**, **Chamunda**, and **Kali** were prominent. The Sonabidhi puja’s connection to **Kamakhya** and Chandi Tantra underscores its esoteric roots, akin to **Petkati Chamunda** in Maynaguri. The Dignagar idol’s identification with Chinnamasta aligns with Tantric iconography, where self-decapitation symbolizes spiritual liberation.

Subhembari’s black stone altar evokes aniconic worship from the Pala era, a period of Hindu-Buddhist syncretism, similar to the abstract forms of **Tara** or **Marichi**. Both practices contrast with Cooch Behar’s **Boro Debi** (16th century, syncretic with Jaya and Vijaya) and **Kathamiya Durga** (1889, mainstream Hindu), highlighting Bengal’s diverse goddess cults.

### Cultural Significance

Subhembari and Munda Puja enrich West Bengal’s religious landscape, embodying local myths, Tantric influences, and social inclusivity. Subhembari’s worship, with its Scheduled Caste participation and pure milk offerings, reflects Murshidabad’s egalitarian traditions, akin to **Boro Debi**’s non-Brahmanical rituals. Munda Puja, with its head-only idol and myths of divine visions, hunger, and Tantric transformation, evokes awe and reverence, positioning Durga as both creator and destroyer.

The practices’ connections to historical figures (Nayapala, Jamini Roy, Raghunath Pal) and sites (Kamakhya, Bishnupur) underscore their deep-rooted heritage, making them subjects of interest for scholars of religion, anthropology, and art history.
