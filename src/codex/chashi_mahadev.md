# **Chashi Mahadev**

**Chashi Mahadev** (lit. *Farmer Mahadev*) is a folkloric form of the Hindu god **Shiva**, primarily found in **Bengali oral traditions**, where he is depicted as the divine originator of agriculture. The story illustrates Shiva’s intervention in human survival by introducing farming, and portrays a unique blend of divine duty, social ethics, and emotional complexity.



## **Mythological Background**

After the creation of humans by **Brahma**, the gods descended to Earth to witness this new creation. While everyone admired Brahma’s work, **Parvati** (Shiva’s consort) was deeply troubled upon seeing that although humans honored her as *Jagatjanani* (Mother of the Universe), she could not provide them with food. This moral conflict pushed her to urge **Shiva** to take responsibility for ensuring human survival.



## **Descent to Earth**

Following Parvati’s plea, **Shiva**, accompanied by the sage **Narad**, descended to Earth to teach agriculture to humans. They gathered seeds, ploughing tools, and bullocks from **Kubera**, the god of wealth, and arrived on the banks of the **Balluka River**, marking the beginning of divine agriculture.



## **The First Cultivation**

To till the land, Shiva created two bulls: **Kama** (Desire) and **Krodha** (Anger). When he struck them to get them moving, the bulls protested, warning that if a god beat bulls, humans would follow suit. Taking their concern seriously, Shiva declared:

> “From this day, anyone who beats a bull shall be born in a chamar's (leather-worker’s) house.”

This moment symbolically explains a caste origin myth and also represents early notions of **animal protection** in agricultural societies.


## **Teaching Agriculture**

Shiva sowed the seeds by hand, but hesitated due to his physical form—his large belly and heavy matted hair. Nonetheless, encouraged by Narad, he completed the task. **Indra**, the god of rain, was then invoked to pour rain over the fields. As crops began to grow, Shiva taught humans how to plant, nurture, and harvest them.

This marked the beginning of **structured agriculture** on Earth according to the legend, and earned Shiva the title **Chashi Mahadev**—the divine farmer.



## **The Kunchani Incident and Panchananda**

While resting near a pond, Shiva was approached by a group of women called the **Kunchani girls**. Among them, a woman named **Revati** formed a relationship with Shiva. From this union, a child named **Panchananda** was born, having **blue skin** at birth.

Villagers, seeing him as illegitimate, abandoned the child in the forest. The **Sun God** saw the infant and warmed him, turning his skin red. Shiva, in meditative trance, sensed the truth and rushed to meet his son—demonstrating divine paternal affection.


## **Narad’s Warning and Shiva’s Dilemma**

Narad, observing Shiva’s actions, warned him that he would inform **Parvati** of everything. Though Shiva pleaded, Narad remained firm and left for **Mount Kailash**, symbolizing the inescapability of **moral consequences**, even for the gods.


## **Symbolism**

* **Divine Empathy**: The tale elevates Shiva as a god who labors for human survival.
* **Origins of Farming**: Establishes a mythic foundation for agriculture in Bengali rural belief.
* **Social Morality**: Introduces the ethical implications of violence toward animals and caste-related consequences.
* **Duality of Divinity**: Reflects on Shiva’s human-like flaws—desire, fatherhood, and emotional struggle.



## **Legacy**

Though not part of canonical Hindu scriptures, the **Chashi Mahadev** myth survives in **oral storytelling traditions** across Bengal. It is especially popular among **agrarian communities**, where the tale is told to emphasize the dignity of labor, divine compassion, and the moral responsibilities of gods and humans alike.
