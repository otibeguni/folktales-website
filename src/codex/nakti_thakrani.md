# Nakti Thakarani

**Nakti Thakarani** (Bengali: নাকটি ঠাকরাণ) is a folk deity worshiped primarily in parts of Bengal, especially around the Ishnath region and Purbasthali. The deity is notable for a unique iconographic feature—a missing or cut nose—which is central to her associated legends and cult practices. Nakti Thakarani blends royal symbolism with folk mythology, embodying both benevolent and fearsome aspects.

## Iconography and Description

Nakti Thakarani is typically depicted as a quadrilateral (chaturbhuj) figure with four arms, seated majestically on an elephant. She holds traditional divine weapons and symbols: a trident (trishula), mace (gada), elephant goad (ankush), and sword (khadga). The defining physical trait is her cut or missing nose, giving rise to her name—'Nakti' meaning “cut nose” and 'Thakarani' referring to a revered female figure.

Her royal regalia and elephant mount symbolically connect her to the Vedic god Indra, whose divine vehicle is the elephant Airavata. This iconographic similarity suggests syncretism between folk and classical Hindu religious imagery.

## Mythological Origins and Local Legends

Local folklore describes Nakti Thakarani as originally the wife of Ishnath, a regional deity or worshiped figure. After a domestic dispute, Ishnath cut off her nose to prevent her departure from home. This act of mutilation is believed to explain the noseless idol and her name.

This tragic legend touches on themes of conflict, sacrifice, and transformation, reflecting deep emotional and cultural narratives within the region.

## Cult and Worship Practices

Historically, Nakti Thakarani was worshiped in open-air shrines, often under Kusum trees (Schleichera oleosa), which are common sacred sites in Bengal’s folk religion. Near Ishnath’s cremation ground, a quadrangular idol was placed under such a tree.

In Purbasthali, a large banyan tree served as her sanctuary (thana), with a bamboo structure built around its trunk for worship. Adjacent to this shrine is a pond called Nakti Pokur, where locals report sightings of a mysterious black, curly-haired woman fishing at night—believed to be the deity herself manifesting.

Her worship involved agrarian rituals and social offerings. However, modernization has led to the decline of her cult and disappearance of physical shrines.

## Nakti Thakarani and Nakakati: Two Related Figures

Nakakati is a related figure described as an *opadevatā*—a malevolent or evil spirit—worshiped under a banyan tree near Nakti Thakarani’s pond. Unlike Nakti Thakarani, Nakakati was not regarded as a goddess but a feared demoness, with her cult now extinct.

This duality illustrates the complex spectrum of folk deities in Bengal, where distinctions between gods, goddesses, and spirits are fluid.

## Possible Identification with Surpanakha

Scholars note parallels between Nakti Thakarani and Surpanakha from the Hindu epic Ramayana, both known for their mutilated noses and liminal divine-demonic status.

In Hindu rituals like *tarpana* (offerings to spirits), demons are sometimes venerated as *opadevatās,* suggesting that the worship of Nakti Thakarani or Nakakati may be folk survivals of ancient rites to appease supernatural forces.

## Cultural Significance and Legacy

Nakti Thakarani embodies the intertwining of mythology, gender dynamics, and power in Bengali folk religion. Although her worship has largely faded, her stories and remnants form part of Bengal’s intangible cultural heritage.

The apparition in Nakti Pokur symbolizes the enduring presence of folk deities in everyday life.
