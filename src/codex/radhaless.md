# Radha-Less Krishna Worship in Cooch Behar

The **Radha-less Krishna worship** is a distinctive Vaishnava tradition in Cooch Behar, West Bengal, where Lord Krishna is worshipped without Radha, emphasizing monotheistic devotion to Krishna as the supreme deity. This practice, rooted in the *Ekeshwarvad* (monotheistic) philosophy, was propagated by saints like Shankaradev, Madhavadev, and Damodar Dev and supported by Cooch Behar’s royalty. This article explores the historical development, rituals, and cultural significance of this unique tradition.

## Overview
In Cooch Behar’s historic **Madanmohan Thakurbari**, Lord Krishna, worshipped as **Madanmohan Thakur**, is venerated without Radha, diverging from the common Radha-Krishna pairing in Vaishnavism. This tradition, known as **Ekeshwarvad**, emphasizes devotion to Krishna as the sole divine entity, reflecting a monotheistic approach influenced by ancient texts and local saints.

## Historical Development
### Vaishnavism’s Influence
The spread of Vaishnavism in medieval India, particularly through figures like Shankaracharya, transformed religious practices. Vedic sun worship evolved into Krishna worship, with a focus on fostering devotion across castes and religions. South India’s four Vaishnava sects—Ramanuja’s Shri, Madhvacharya’s Brahma, Vishnuswami’s Rudra, and Nimbarkacharya’s Sanaka—played a significant role. The Sanaka sect acknowledged Radha’s existence, as seen in Jayadeva’s *Gita Govinda*, which celebrates Radha and Krishna’s divine love, and in the works of poets like Chandidas and Vidyapati, inspired by Chaitanya Dev.

However, in Cooch Behar, the *Ekeshwarvad* philosophy, propagated by Shankaradev, Madhavadev, and Damodar Dev, emphasized Krishna alone. Ancient texts like the *Mahabharata*, *Harivamsha*, and *Bhagavata Purana* declare Krishna as “Bhagavan Svayam” (God Himself). The *Upanishads* mention Krishna’s chief gopi as Gandharva, with no reference to Radha. Swami Binishchayananda’s essay in *Sri Ramakrishna’s Life* explains that Krishna created Radha from his own being, suggesting they are one entity, forming the complete divine essence of Krishna.

### Royal Patronage
Cooch Behar’s kings, including Naranarayan, Lakshminarayan, Birnarayan, Rupnarayan, and Prananarayan, promoted Radha-less Krishna worship. During King Rupnarayan’s reign, Radha-less Krishna idols such as **Gopinath**, Giridharilal, Shyamsundar, Jagabandhu, and Chaturbhuja Thakur were distributed. The **Gopinath idol** is currently worshipped daily at the home of Sri Debabrata Chaki, whose maternal lineage held the “Medhi” title and received ₹51 monthly from the Cooch Behar Debottar Trust Board for the puja.

## Rituals and Practices
### Madanmohan Thakurbari
The **Madanmohan Thakurbari**, established in 1889 during Maharaja Nripendranarayan’s reign, is the center of Radha-less Krishna worship in Cooch Behar. On May 4, 1890, the newly built Madanmohan Temple hosted the first **Ras Utsav**, a 15-day festival in November–December, known as the **Ras Mela**. The festival features the **Ras Chakra**, a 30-foot-tall structure adorned with images of deities and Krishna’s forms, framed on paper with a spire and bamboo poles for rotation. This structure resembles Tibetan Buddhist Kalachakras and Muharram’s taziyas. Artist Altab Miya and his family have crafted the Ras Chakra for generations.

### Ras Mela
The Ras Mela, a significant cultural event, blends traditional and modern elements. Historically, its character differed during the royal era, but it has adapted to contemporary influences while preserving its ancient essence. The festival attracts devotees and visitors, celebrating Krishna’s divine forms through rituals, art, and community participation.

## Cultural Significance
The Radha-less Krishna worship in Cooch Behar reflects a monotheistic Vaishnava tradition that prioritizes Krishna as the supreme deity. By excluding Radha, this practice emphasizes a direct, singular devotion to Krishna, aligning with the *Ekeshwarvad* philosophy. The Ras Mela and the worship of idols like Gopinath underscore Cooch Behar’s rich cultural and religious heritage, supported by royal patronage and local traditions. The festival’s Ras Chakra, with its artistic and symbolic significance, highlights the region’s ability to integrate ancient practices with modern expressions of faith.
