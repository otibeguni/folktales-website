# Kanak Durga Puja

The **Kanak Durga Puja** is a traditional Hindu worship ceremony dedicated to **Kanak Durga**, a manifestation of Goddess Durga, revered in Chiksigarh, located in West Medinipur, West Bengal, India. This puja is distinguished by its unique origin story, rituals, and historical significance, particularly the transition from human sacrifice to a symbolic offering known as *Biram Bhog*.

## Origin and Legend

According to local tradition, the Kanak Durga Puja originated when a king of Chiksigarh received a divine vision of Goddess Durga in a dream. In the dream, the goddess instructed the king to create her idol using golden bangles from the queens’ hands, declaring, "I shall become Kanak Durga of Chiksigarh." She specified that her idol should be four-armed (*Chaturbhuja*), holding a skull, a gesture of blessing (*barabhaya*), a horse’s reins, and a sword. Unlike the traditional depiction of Durga with a tiger or lion as her mount, Kanak Durga’s mount is a horse, and she is adorned in blue attire (*Nilambari*). Following this divine command, the king commissioned a four-armed idol of Kanak Durga crafted from the queens’ golden bangles.

## Historical Practices

In earlier times, the Kanak Durga temple was associated with the controversial practice of human sacrifice, known as *Nisha Bali* (night sacrifice). On the night of Ashtami, individuals were captured and sacrificed outside the temple. After the sacrifice, portions of the victim’s flesh and blood were sprinkled around a nearby deep well, referred to as the *Patal Kua*. The ritual concluded with a ceremonial plea for forgiveness, performed by pressing faces to the ground, acknowledging the moral weight of the act.

This practice was discontinued following a significant event involving a Brahmin boy selected for sacrifice. Facing certain death, the boy began chanting Durga mantras in front of the temple. Queen Gobindamani, upon hearing the chants, intervened and halted the sacrifice. From that day, human sacrifice was banned at the Kanak Durga temple, marking a pivotal shift in the temple’s rituals.

## Biram Bhog Ritual

In place of human sacrifice, the temple introduced the *Biram Bhog* ritual, a unique offering that remains a central feature of the Kanak Durga Puja. The ritual involves preparing a large earthen pot filled with meat, one kilogram of ghee, various spices, and salt. The pot is sealed with sal leaves and tied with a rope made of babui grass. It is then placed on a fire kindled by a Brahmin, and seed mantras are chanted while stirring the contents with a ladle. After stirring, the ladle is placed on the pot, the room is locked, and everyone leaves. The meat continues to cook overnight. The following day, before the Navami puja concludes, the room is opened, revealing that the meat has been cooked. Devotees believe that Kanak Durga herself cooks the *Biram Bhog*, a tradition that symbolizes the deity’s divine intervention following the cessation of human sacrifice.

## Cultural and Religious Significance

The Kanak Durga Puja is a significant cultural and religious event in Chiksigarh, blending devotion, folklore, and historical transformation. The transition from human sacrifice to the *Biram Bhog* ritual reflects a shift toward more humane practices while maintaining the spiritual reverence for Kanak Durga. The deity’s unique iconography—depicted with a horse as her mount and clad in blue—sets her apart from traditional representations of Durga, adding to the distinctiveness of the puja.

The temple and its rituals continue to attract devotees who honor Kanak Durga’s divine presence and the legend of her manifestation in Chiksigarh. The *Biram Bhog* ritual, in particular, is a testament to the community’s adaptation of religious practices in response to ethical considerations, preserving the sanctity of the puja while embracing change.
