# Tistaburi

**Tistaburi** (Bengali: তিস্তাবুড়ি) is a regional folk deity worshipped in the northern part of West Bengal, especially in areas near the Teesta River such as Dinajpur, Cooch Behar, and Jalpaiguri. She is considered one of the "Panch Buri" or "Five Old Women" deities that are venerated in various forms across the Bengal region. Tistaburi is deeply associated with river worship, fertility, protection, and healing. Her worship includes vibrant folk rituals, female-led processions, and symbolic representations through natural materials like stones and clay. The tradition reflects a blend of indigenous tribal beliefs and syncretic Hindu practices.

## Etymology and Origins
The name "Tistaburi" combines "Teesta" (referring to the Teesta River) and "buri" (meaning "old woman" or "elderly female spirit" in Bengali folklore). The worship of Tistaburi is believed to have emerged among the indigenous Mech tribe and later spread among the Rajbanshi and other local communities. Some scholars believe the deity's name derives from riverine worship traditions associated with the Mechi or Teesta rivers.

Dr. Francis Buchanan Hamilton's 1809 account of Rangpur mentions Tista as the primary deity of Fakirganj, indicating that the river held sacred significance even then. Over time, the river goddess evolved into the deity known as Tistaburi.

## Mythology and Folk Beliefs
In folk narratives, Tistaburi is often counted among the "Panch Buri" (Five Elder Women), which includes:

- Tistaburi  
- Ganga Buri  
- Shitalaburi  
- Olaburi  
- Chandburi  

According to one legend, Shiva came to earth and lived with a girl from the Mech tribe. Alarmed, Parvati and Ganga took on Mech disguises to follow him. Eventually, they gave birth to Kartik and Ganesha. Some versions of this tale position Tistaburi as one of the Mech women in disguise, suggesting a syncretic fusion of tribal and Hindu cosmology.

Another theory attributes the deity's origins to worship practices along the Mechi River, with later adoption by mainstream Rajbanshi society. This folk syncretism is central to understanding Tistaburi's identity.

## Rituals and Worship
Tistaburi's worship is conducted primarily by women during the month of Boishakh (April-May), with the culminating ritual held on the last day of the month. Her main priestess is known as the Mayarani, who is accompanied by a group of women devotees referred to as bratinis.

The Mayarani carries a clay image or a piece of polished stone symbolizing Tistaburi, placed in a decorated flower basket beneath an umbrella adorned with white alpana (ritual art). The women visit local homes or markets to collect offerings (magan), singing:

> “Muthi muthi mor bathua shaak,  
> Chhone mutti mor titli paate,  
> Ena mor ke he tarir chaangra...”

The householders, referred to as saudani, prepare a seat for the goddess near the tulsi altar. Offerings include rice, lentils, vegetables, and coins. After dancing on wet clay, the bratinis bless the home with flowers, vermilion, and rice.

### Tistaburi Bathing Ritual
On the final day of the month, the worshippers go to the Teesta or Panga rivers for a ritual bath. The women, led by the Mayarani, dance and splash in the water, presenting milk, yogurt, bananas, sweets, and earthen lamps to the river goddess.

### Devdhi Priest and Trance Rituals
In some locations, particularly near Fakirganj, the male priest known as Devdhi leads the ritual. The Devdhi enters a trance state during the puja, whipping himself with a cane and offering sacred soil from the deity's altar to devotees seeking healing or fertility. The invocation begins with:

> “Ei dharti te bosi jabo,  
> Tishshal kuti devgan…”

## Associated Folk Songs and Mecheni Tradition
Tistaburi puja is intertwined with a folk performance tradition known as Mecheni or Mecheni Khela. These are ritual folk songs and dances performed in circular groups, often by women, during the deity's worship. The origin of the name "Mecheni" is debated; some believe it refers to the Mech tribe, while others say it comes from early river worship along the Mechi River.

In the Terai region, these practices are still known as Mecheni Khela or Bratagaan Khela, preserving the region’s indigenous heritage.

## Comparative Folk Deities and Fertility Worship
Tistaburi shares thematic elements with other regional folk deities, such as:

- Jatadhar Thakur, worshipped in Katwa and Bohoran, often represented by sacred trees and associated with ganja offerings.  
- Nyangta Thakur of Bankura, possibly a Jain Tirthankara reimagined as a fertility god.  
- Bhurbhu Shiva, near the Subarnarekha River, who receives flower offerings in rituals called Phulgandha.

These deities often serve similar roles in granting children, healing, and safeguarding communities, and their rituals reflect a fusion of tribal customs and mainstream religious motifs.

## Cultural Significance
Tistaburi puja highlights themes of female solidarity, ecological reverence, and vernacular spiritual expression. In an era of rapid modernization and digital detachment, these rituals maintain deep emotional bonds and preserve the legacy of Bengal’s folk spirituality.
