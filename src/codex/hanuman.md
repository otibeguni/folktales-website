# Hanuman Worship in West Bengal

The worship of **Hanuman**, the revered monkey god from the *Ramayana*, is a significant religious and cultural practice in West Bengal, particularly among the Rajbanshi community in North Bengal. Known for his strength, devotion, and loyalty to Lord Rama, Hanuman is primarily venerated as a folk deity in the form of a **Hanuman Nishan**, a triangular red flag, rather than an idol. This article explores the rituals, myths, and cultural significance of Hanuman worship in the region, as well as its broader mythological context across India and beyond.

## Overview
In the Rajbanshi community, Hanuman is worshipped as a symbol of strength and divine protection, often without a physical idol. The **Hanuman Nishan**, a red triangular flag, is the primary object of reverence, embodying Hanuman’s presence. This practice is deeply rooted in local folklore and mythology, particularly linked to the *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana*. An exception to this tradition exists in Dhumdahpara, Chamta village, Sitai Thana, where Hanuman is worshipped as an idol during the **Ashok Ashtami Mela**.

## Mythological Origins
### Kurukshetra Connection
A prominent myth from the *Mahabharata* recounts the encounter between Hanuman and Bhima, both sons of Vayu (the wind god) and thus brothers. Before the Kurukshetra war, Bhima met Hanuman but initially refused to believe his identity. To convince Bhima, Hanuman assumed his colossal, mountain-like form, prompting Bhima to acknowledge his mistake and apologize. Hanuman promised to aid the Pandavas by sitting atop Arjuna’s chariot flag during the war, assisting in defeating their enemies. This association with the flag (*nishan*) led to Hanuman being worshipped as the Hanuman Nishan in Rajbanshi society.

### Hanuman Danda
Another local legend involves King Bishwasingha of Cooch Behar, who, following a divine command from Lord Shiva (Mahadev), crafted a silver monkey figure and placed its head and bones on a ceremonial staff known as the **Hanuman Danda**. This staff is ritually brought from the Madanmohan Temple to the Baro Devi Temple during pujas, a practice dating back to the royal era.

### Makardhwaja and Southeast Asian Narratives
A unique folk story describes Hanuman’s son, **Makardhwaja**, a half-monkey, half-fish being. When Hanuman’s tail was set ablaze in Lanka, he extinguished it in the ocean, and his sweat impregnated a fish, leading to Makardhwaja’s birth in the underworld (*Patala*). Raised by Ahiravana, Makardhwaja became a gatekeeper. When Hanuman arrived to rescue Rama and Lakshmana, imprisoned by Ahiravana, he confronted Makardhwaja, who claimed to be his son. After a fierce battle, Hanuman defeated Makardhwaja, killed Ahiravana, and rescued Rama and Lakshmana. This tale, absent from the standard *Ramayana*, is prevalent in Indian folklore and shares similarities with Southeast Asian versions, such as the Cambodian and Thai *Ramayana*, where Hanuman’s son **Macchanu**, born to Svarnamatsya (Ravana’s daughter), plays a similar role.

In the Thai *Ramakien*, Hanuman aids in building the Ramasetu by inscribing Rama’s name on floating stones to cross the ocean. In Malaysian mythology, Hanuman is depicted as the son of Rama and Sita, born during their temporary transformation into monkeys. In Chinese Buddhism, particularly in Xuanzang’s 16th-century *Journey to the West*, Hanuman appears as the “Golden Monkey,” a powerful, pleasure-seeking warrior.

## Rituals and Practices
### Hanuman Nishan
In the Rajbanshi community, Hanuman worship typically involves the **Hanuman Nishan**, a triangular red flag measuring 8–10 hands in length. On the first day of Baisakh (Bengali New Year), alongside deities like Shiva, Radha-Krishna, and Kali, the previous year’s flag is replaced with a new one tied to a bamboo pole. This pole is planted on the southern side of the Tulsi platform, where offerings such as curd, flattened rice, sugar, milk, parboiled rice, and bananas are presented to the deities.

### Ashok Ashtami Mela
In Dhumdahpara, Chamta village, Sitai Thana, the **Ashok Ashtami Mela** features Hanuman as the primary deity, worshipped as an idol rather than a flag. This is a notable exception to the Rajbanshi tradition of flag-based worship.

### Hanuman Danda in Baro Devi Puja
During the Baro Devi puja, the Halua community brings the **Hanuman Danda** from the Madanmohan Temple to the Baro Devi Temple. Offerings include a pair of pigeons and a pot of rice, accompanied by prayers to Mother Durga: “Ma Durga, we offer this puja to you.”

## Cultural Significance
Hanuman’s worship in West Bengal reflects his enduring popularity as a symbol of strength, loyalty, and devotion. The absence of temples dedicated to other animals in India underscores Hanuman’s unique status. Scholars suggest that Hanuman may represent ancient warrior tribes of central India’s forests, with the term “banar” (monkey) deriving from “ban” (forest) and “nar” (man). His depiction as a red-faced, golden-bodied figure with immense strength, shape-shifting abilities, and a massive tail resonates across cultures.

Hanuman’s presence extends beyond India to Southeast Asian mythologies (Cambodian, Thai, Vietnamese, Burmese, Malaysian) and Chinese Buddhism, where he is portrayed as a powerful, demon-slaying figure or a warrior. In Gujarat’s Jethi community, Hanuman’s descendant **Jethidhwaja** is revered, with his image on royal flags, and Hanuman and Makardhwaja are worshipped together as **Balaji Hanuman** in some temples.

## Broader Mythological Context
Hanuman’s significance spans multiple religious traditions:
- **Vaishnavism**: As Rama’s devoted follower and sometimes brother, per the *Ananda Ramayana*.
- **Shaivism**: As an incarnation of Shiva or the son of Shiva and Mohini.
- **Buddhism**: Indirectly in *Jataka Tales* as a shape-shifting figure.
- **Jainism and Southeast Asian Traditions**: As a powerful, non-ascetic warrior attracting female figures.

Evidence of Hanuman worship in pre-Vedic times and engravings resembling him in the Indus Valley Civilization suggest his ancient origins, though their exact nature remains debated.
