# Khepima

**Khepima** (Bengali: খেপিমা), also known as the **Mother Durga of Eighteen Figurines**, is a unique manifestation of the Hindu goddess **Durga** worshipped in **Padmakandir village**, Murshidabad, West Bengal, India. Renowned for her elaborate idol comprising eighteen figurines and a myth associating her with the consumption of a child, Khepima embodies a syncretic and eccentric form of the goddess, akin to **Petkati Durga** in the same region. Her name, derived from *khepi* (implying eccentricity or madness), reflects her enigmatic and fearsome persona, rooted in local folklore and religious traditions.

## Etymology

The name **Khepima** likely stems from the Bengali term *khepi*, suggesting eccentricity, unpredictability, or a devouring nature. This is tied to a myth where a piece of a missing girl’s clothing was found at the idol’s lips, implying the deity’s consumption of the child. The epithet “Mother Durga of Eighteen Figurines” refers to her idol’s complex composition, which includes eighteen distinct figures, far exceeding the standard seven figurines of traditional Durga idols.

## Iconography

Khepima’s idol is distinctive for its elaborate structure, comprising **eighteen figurines**:
- **Central Deity**: A **four-armed Durga**, slaying the demon Mahishasura, seated on a lion.
- **Companions**: Unlike conventional Durga idols featuring Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartik, Khepima’s entourage includes **Jaya and Vijaya** (her companions, depicted as yellow-complexioned, similar to **Boro Debi** in Cooch Behar), **Rati**, **Madan**, **Shiva** with **Nandi** and **Bhringi**, and two **crocodiles (makara)** on either side.
- **Additional Figures**: Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartik, the demon, and the lion are also present, bringing the total to eighteen.

This complex iconography sets Khepima apart from mainstream Durga depictions, such as **Kathamiya Durga** in Cooch Behar, which adheres to the standard seven-figurine format, or **Boro Debi**, which features Jaya and Vijaya but excludes the four children. The presence of crocodiles and Tantric figures like Rati and Madan suggests a syncretic blend of Hindu and local folk elements.

## Mythology and Legends

### Padmakandir

The worship of Khepima originated from a divine vision received by a man named **Majumdar** during a devastating flood in Padmakandir. In his dream, a four-armed goddess appeared, claiming she had been swept away by the flood and lay near a pond in the village’s fields. She instructed Majumdar to retrieve and install her idol. Upon finding the idol, Majumdar recognized it as the **Mother Durga of Eighteen Figurines**, matching his vision.

Another myth, strikingly similar to that of **Petkati Durga** in Murshidabad, recounts an incident during an Ashtami puja. A young girl attending the festival with her parents vanished in the crowd. After a frantic search, a piece of her clothing was found caught at the corner of Khepima’s idol’s lips, suggesting the deity had consumed her. This eerie event led to the deity being named **Khepima**, evoking her eccentric or devouring nature. Unlike Petkati Durga, where the child was retrieved by cutting open the idol’s belly, Khepima’s myth does not specify the girl’s fate, amplifying the deity’s mysterious aura.

### Comparison with Petkati Durga

The myths of Khepima and **Petkati Durga** share remarkable similarities, both involving a missing girl and the deity’s association with consumption. While Petkati Durga’s idol features a cleaved belly symbolizing the retrieval of a child, Khepima’s eighteen-figurine structure and the clothing fragment at her lips emphasize her enigmatic and fearsome character. These parallels suggest a shared regional tradition of goddess worship in Murshidabad, where Durga is portrayed as both protective and devouring.

## Khyada Parvati of Deuli

Though not directly related to Khepima, the narrative transitions to another goddess, **Khyada Parvati** (Noseless Parvati), worshipped in **Deuli**, Birbhum, West Bengal. Her story provides context for the broader tradition of goddess worship in Bengal, including humanized or damaged deities.

### Legend of Khyada Parvati

Long ago, a Brahmin in Deuli had a son and a daughter. After their birth, he received a divine command to dedicate his son as a temple attendant. He also appointed his daughter as a **devadasi** (temple dancer), skilled in dance and music. A local king frequently visited the temple, forming a friendship with the devadasi that soon turned into love. The Brahmin’s son, disapproving of this relationship, planned to poison the king. Tragically, the poisoned food was consumed by his sister, who died instantly. Devastated, the king built a temple in Deuli, commissioning a **six-foot stone idol** in her likeness, deifying her as a goddess.

The idol, originally a **ten-armed Durga or Parvati** seated on a lion, was later damaged. In 1568, during Muslim invasions, the invader **Kalapahar** destroyed the temple and defaced the idol by cutting off its nose and breaking two of its front arms, reducing it to an **eight-armed deity**. Since then, the deity has been known as **Khyada Parvati**. A dalan-style temple was later constructed, and her worship resumed, though the idol remains damaged.

### Iconography of Khyada Parvati

- **Appearance**: A six-foot stone idol, originally ten-armed but now eight-armed due to damage, seated on a lion.
- **Damage**: The idol’s nose was cut off, and two front arms were broken, possibly during Kalapahar’s attack or due to natural decay.
- **Syncretism**: The idol’s humanized origin, modeled after the devadasi, reflects the deification of a mortal, a theme resonant with Khepima’s complex mythology.

## Historical and Cultural Context

### Khepima and Bengal’s Goddess Traditions

Khepima’s worship reflects Bengal’s rich tradition of goddess cults, blending Hindu, Tantric, and folk elements. The presence of Jaya and Vijaya, as seen in **Boro Debi** of Cooch Behar, and figures like Rati and Madan suggest a syncretic influence, possibly linked to Tantric practices prevalent during the **Pala period** (8th–12th centuries CE). Unlike **Petkati Durga**, which emphasizes a Tantric, hunger-driven deity, Khepima’s eighteen-figurine idol and child-consumption myth evoke a blend of awe and fear, positioning her as both protector and eccentric devourer.

### Khyada Parvati and Human Deification

The story of Khyada Parvati illustrates the humanization of deities, a recurring theme in Bengal’s religious history. The devadasi’s deification parallels global fertility cults, as noted in the text, where goddesses like **Aphrodite**, **Freya**, and **Juno** symbolized creation and desire. The text also critiques the objectification of women in ancient practices, such as Babylonian temple customs documented by **Herodotus**, where women were compelled to serve as temporary consorts. Khyada Parvati’s origin as a mortal woman elevated to divine status underscores this tension between reverence and exploitation.

### Comparison with Cooch Behar Pujas

- **Boro Debi Puja**: Originating in the 16th century, it features a red-complexioned Durga with Jaya and Vijaya, dual mounts (tiger and lion), and syncretic Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical rituals. Khepima shares the presence of Jaya and Vijaya but is distinguished by her eighteen figurines and flood-related origin myth.
- **Kathamiya Durga Puja**: Established in 1889, it adheres to conventional Durga iconography with seven figurines and mainstream rituals. Khepima’s complex idol and eccentric mythology contrast sharply with this standardized worship.

## Ritual Practices

Specific rituals for Khepima’s worship in Padmakandir are not detailed in the source, but the myth suggests a traditional Durga Puja framework, likely held during the standard festival period (Mahalaya to Dashami). Key elements may include:
- **Idol Installation**: Following Majumdar’s discovery of the idol, it was likely installed in a temple or puja site in Padmakandir, with the eighteen-figurine structure crafted annually or preserved as a permanent idol.
- **Puja Ceremonies**: The puja likely emphasizes the deity’s flood-related origin and child-consumption myth, with offerings reflecting her protective yet fearsome nature.
- **Community Involvement**: The Ashtami incident involving the missing girl suggests significant community participation, with the puja serving as a focal point for local devotion and storytelling.

In contrast, **Khyada Parvati**’s worship in Deuli involves rituals in a dalan-style temple, focusing on the damaged eight-armed idol. The puja likely follows traditional Parvati or Durga worship practices, adapted to the idol’s historical damage.

## Cultural Significance

Khepima represents a unique facet of Murshidabad’s religious landscape, embodying the region’s penchant for syncretic and enigmatic goddess worship. Her eighteen-figurine idol and child-consumption myth parallel **Petkati Durga**, highlighting a shared tradition of Durga as a devouring deity. The name *Khepima*, with its connotation of eccentricity, underscores her departure from the benevolent mother archetype, evoking a complex interplay of reverence and fear.

Khyada Parvati’s story in Deuli reflects Bengal’s tradition of human deification, where mortals, particularly women, are elevated to divine status. Her damaged idol, bearing the scars of historical invasions, serves as a tangible link to the region’s turbulent past, making her worship a blend of devotion and historical remembrance.

Together, Khepima and Khyada Parvati enrich Bengal’s diverse Durga Puja traditions, distinct from the royal-sponsored **Boro Debi** and **Kathamiya Durga** pujas of Cooch Behar, yet resonant with the region’s syncretic and folk-driven religious heritage.

## Temples and Sites

- **Padmakandir, Murshidabad**: The primary site of Khepima’s worship, likely centered around a temple or puja site where the eighteen-figurine idol is venerated.
- **Deuli, Birbhum**: The dalan-style temple housing the damaged **Khyada Parvati** idol, a significant site for Parvati worship and historical reflection.
