# Urubulu Worship in West Bengal

#### Overview
**Urubulu worship** is a unique folk tradition practiced in the rural areas surrounding Shashgram, a village along the Subarnarekha River in West Bengal, India. This ritual is performed to retrieve stray cattle believed to be claimed by **Manki Raja**, a local figure associated with the village of Shashgram. The practice reflects the agrarian culture of the region, where livestock is vital to the livelihood of farmers, and it underscores the deep-rooted folk beliefs that intertwine spirituality with daily life.

#### Cultural and Historical Context
In the villages near Shashgram, agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary means of sustenance. Local folklore instills fear among farmers that if their cows or oxen wander into Shashgram, they are permanently claimed by **Manki Raja**, a legendary or divine figure whose cattle shed is said to hold such animals captive. The only recourse for farmers to retrieve their livestock is to perform the **Urubulu Puja**, a ritual dedicated to the deity or spirit known as Urubulu.

The identity of Urubulu remains ambiguous in the available accounts, potentially representing a local deity or spirit associated with the protection or reclamation of livestock. The practice is emblematic of folk traditions in rural Bengal, where supernatural beliefs address practical concerns, such as the loss of valuable cattle, which are critical to agricultural communities.

#### Rituals and Practices
The **Urubulu Puja** involves a specific set of offerings and rituals to appease the deity and secure the return of stray cattle. The ritual includes:
- **Offerings**: Farmers offer betel leaves (*bishwapatra*), parboiled rice (*atap chal*), jaggery (*gur*), milk (*dudh*), and vermilion (*sindur*).
- **Clay Horse Dedication**: A key component of the puja is the offering of a clay horse, which is considered essential to the ritual. The horse likely holds symbolic significance, possibly representing a divine vehicle or an offering to appease Manki Raja or Urubulu.

The ritual is performed with the intent of invoking Urubulu’s intervention to release the cattle from Manki Raja’s control, allowing them to return to their owners.

#### Cultural Significance
The Urubulu worship tradition highlights the intersection of agrarian life and folk religion in rural West Bengal. It reflects the anxieties of farmers whose livelihoods depend on livestock and the cultural mechanisms developed to address such concerns through spiritual practices. The ritual’s reliance on simple, locally available offerings like betel leaves, jaggery, and clay horses underscores the accessibility of folk worship, which is deeply embedded in the daily lives of rural communities.

The figure of **Manki Raja** and the fear of losing cattle to Shashgram’s domain add a layer of mystique to the region’s folklore, reinforcing the belief in supernatural forces governing agricultural life. The Urubulu Puja serves as a cultural artifact, preserving traditional beliefs while addressing practical challenges faced by farmers.
