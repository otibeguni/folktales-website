# Matrika Puja and Regional Female Deities of North Bengal

**Matrika Puja** (Bengali: মাতৃকী পুজা) is a traditional worship of female deities symbolizing feminine power, fertility, and protection, prevalent in the cultural and religious practices of North Bengal, particularly among the Rajbanshi community and in the Cooch Behar region. The puja centers on several goddesses, including **Jagaddhatri**, **Ghurneshwari**, **Burima (Sheetala)**, **Sungai**, and **Alaikumari**, each with unique mythological significance and ritual practices.

## Jagaddhatri Puja in Cooch Behar

Jagaddhatri, worshipped as a blood-red goddess in Cooch Behar, symbolizes fertility and power. The origins of Jagaddhatri Puja in this region are unclear, but it is believed to have been introduced inspired by contemporary Jagaddhatri celebrations elsewhere. The main Jagaddhatri Puja in Cooch Behar takes place at the Madanmohan House and differs from other versions in its iconography and rituals.

The goddess is depicted with a dark red complexion, having three eyes (Trinayana) and four hands holding a bow, arrow, sword, and chakra. She is flanked by deities Ganesh, Kartik, Lakshmi, and Saraswati, and seated on a lion, beneath which a demon in the form of an elephant is shown—possibly Gajasura, slain by Lord Shiva according to Hindu mythology.

The puja is celebrated during the Kartik month on the 7th, 8th, and 9th days of the waxing moon (Shukla Paksha). Traditional animal sacrifices continue to be part of the ritual. On the ninth day, the goddess is worshipped three times with yajna (fire offerings), and on the tenth day, the idol is immersed (Visarjan). The worship of the blood-red form of Lakshmi also takes place on the Kojagari Lakshmi Puja day at the same venue.

## Kamata and the Goddess Gosana

In the 15th century, King Neeldhabaj of the Khen dynasty established the Kamata kingdom, named after the goddess Kamata, with the capital Kamatapur. Locally, this goddess is referred to as **Gosana**, and the region later became known as Gosanimari. Unlike other deities, no idol of Gosana exists, but her stories are preserved in the folk text *Gosanimangal*.

## Maa Kamakhya and Local Beliefs

Maa Kamakhya is another important goddess in the region, surrounded by various folk legends. One story recounts her anger and curse on King Narnarayan foretelling the fall of his dynasty. This belief influences local customs, such as the royal family members covering their eyes when passing Nilachal Hills, and prohibiting the viewing of the Gosanimari Kamateshwari deity.

## Ghurneshwari: The Goddess of Cyclones

In Chamta village of Tufanganj, a black stone fragment is venerated as **Ghurneshwari**, the goddess of cyclones. Some local beliefs identify the stone as an ancient sacred object called Ukkapinu.

## Burima (Sheetala) Puja

The **Sheetala** or **Burima** Puja is performed to ward off diseases like smallpox, especially during the spring season. According to tradition, the goddess appeared first with a yellow body, and accordingly, her idols are painted yellow. This puja is commonly observed in villages such as Maghpala, Chhatramapur, and Thatarpat in North Bengal.

## Sungai Puja: Worship by Betel Leaf Cultivators

The **Sungai** goddess is primarily worshipped by betel leaf farmers to enhance crop yield. Folklore suggests a proposed marriage between Kartik and Sungai, which was broken, after which Sungai remained unmarried. The Sungai Puja is particularly prominent in Babuhaat village (Cooch Behar) and Dhalpal village (Tufanganj).

## Alaikumari and River Folklore

The folk narratives of North Bengal connect feminine imagery with river origins. The Teesta River’s origin story is well known, and another tale tells of a princess named Alaikumari or Alaikuri who, after rejecting a king’s proposal, drowned herself in a river that was later named after her.

## Worship of Maa Mansa and Bishahari

In Cooch Behar and surrounding areas, the goddesses **Maa Mansa** and **Bishahari** are worshipped widely in folk traditions. These practices are also found in the Rarh region and Jharkhand, where various myths about these deities are part of the oral tradition.
