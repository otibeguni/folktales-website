# Kathamiya Durga Puja

**Kathamiya Durga Puja** is a traditional Hindu festival held annually at the **Madanmohan Temple** in **Cooch Behar**, West Bengal, India. Initiated in **1889**, it is one of the oldest organized **Durga Puja** celebrations in the region, second only to the historically older **Boro Debi Puja**. The puja derives its name from the Bengali word *"Kathamiya"*, meaning "under a single framework", referring to its distinction as the first Durga Puja in Cooch Behar to feature all idols on a single pandal structure, a stylistic innovation during the era of the **Koch dynasty**.

## History

The Kathamiya Durga Puja was inaugurated in **1889** with the establishment of a temple complex opposite **Bairagi Dighi** on a plot of approximately **seven bighas and thirteen kathas**. While Durga Pujas with single frameworks were prevalent in **East Bengal**, historian **Bh. Nripendranath Pal** notes that Kathamiya Durga Puja was the first of its kind in Cooch Behar, marking a significant moment in the evolution of Durga worship in the princely state.

Unlike the **Boro Debi Puja**, which retains unique regional iconography, the Kathamiya Durga idol adheres strictly to the **classical Shakta tradition** and mainstream Hindu iconographic norms.

## Iconography

The iconography of Kathamiya Durga reflects traditional Hindu representations of the goddess:

* **Form**: The goddess is portrayed with a **sandalwood-colored** complexion and **ten arms**, each bearing divine weapons including a **trident**, **sword**, and **spear**.
* **Companions**: Flanked by her children—**Ganesha**, **Kartikeya**, **Lakshmi**, and **Saraswati**—the arrangement follows canonical norms, diverging from local variants such as **Boro Debi**, which features **Jaya** and **Vijaya**.
* **Mythic Battle**: The image includes **Mahishasura** (the buffalo demon) being pierced by her trident while her **lion mount** charges at him, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.

This iconographic conformity sets Kathamiya Durga apart from the more syncretic and localized forms found elsewhere in Cooch Behar.

## Rituals and Observances

### Preparatory Rituals

* **Shashthi (Sixth Day)**: Four **bilva** (bael) fruits are consecrated at **Baneshwar Shiva Temple** and later divided—two are retained for the Kathamiya Puja, and two are given to **Boro Debi’s shrine**. The latter are wrapped in red cloth, anointed with vermilion, and placed as *"Matristana"* or symbolic breasts of the mother goddess during **Bishwabaran Puja**.
* **Saptami (Seventh Day)**: A **copper kalasha** is installed beside a temporary **thatched structure** housing the **yajna-kund** (fire altar). A continuous sacred fire is maintained from Saptami to Navami, a custom observed by local priestly lineages.

### Main Festival Days

* **Sandhi Puja**: Conducted at the twilight juncture between **Ashtami** and **Navami**, this ritual is considered spiritually potent, symbolizing the moment of Durga’s fierce transformation.
* **Navami**: In addition to the main worship and **bhog** (ritual offerings), young **virgin girls (Kumari)** and **Brahmins** are ritually fed at noon. The girls are gifted clothes, while Brahmins receive **dakshina**.
* **Dashami (Tenth Day)**: The **kalasha** is immersed in the morning, followed by the immersion of the idol in the **Torsha River** by **3:30 PM**. The **Aparajita Puja**, a culminating ritual, includes joint worship of kalashas from **Kathamiya Durga**, **Boro Debi**, and **Madanmohan Temple deities**, alongside **Narayana Puja**. Traditional sacrifices include a **goat**, **pumpkin**, **sugarcane**, and **citron**. Previously, **tortoises** were offered, a practice replaced by two **magur fish** in accordance with modern regulations.

### Historical Practices

During the **Koch royal period**, the puja’s final rites included processions to the **Cooch Behar Palace**, where the **Aparajita Kalasha** was ceremonially received. The palace’s **Durbar Hall** hosted the **Yatra Shastra Puja**, wherein the monarch’s weapons were sanctified, highlighting the king’s role as the protector of dharma. These traditions were discontinued after **1959**.

## Cultural Significance

Kathamiya Durga Puja embodies the **religious continuity** and **ritual orthodoxy** of Cooch Behar’s temple culture. In contrast to the eclectic **Boro Debi** worship, Kathamiya Durga emphasizes **Brahmanical ritual structure**, mainstream **Durga iconography**, and formal **fire sacrifices**. The use of **sacred bilva fruits**, reliance on hereditary **idol-makers** like **Manik Pal of Gunjabari**, and uninterrupted performance of **yajnas** represent deep intergenerational transmission of tradition.

## Administration

The puja is organized and maintained by the **Debottar Trust Board**, which oversees temple properties and rituals originally instituted under the patronage of the **Koch royal family**. The Trust ensures ritual continuity, festival funding, and the engagement of hereditary priests and artisans.
