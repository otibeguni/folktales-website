# Manasa in Folk Traditions of Bengal

**Manasa**, the serpent goddess, is a prominent deity in the folk traditions of Bengal, especially in North Bengal, South 24 Parganas, and adjacent regions of West Bengal and Bangladesh. Known by various local names such as **Hardhaddi Manasa**, **Jhankalai**, and **Bannagini**, she is revered as a protector against snakebites and as a deity of fertility and prosperity. Her worship blends Vedic mythology with regional folk beliefs, often integrating narratives involving Shiva, Parvati, and local figures. This article explores the diverse folk manifestations of Manasa and their cultural significance in Bengal’s rural communities.


## Overview

Manasa holds a central position in Bengal's folk religion as the goddess of snakes, worshipped widely to ensure protection from venomous serpents and to bring fertility and well-being. Folk traditions vary by region:

* In **North Bengal**, she is known as **Hardhaddi Manasa**, associated with myths of resurrection.
* In **South 24 Parganas**, she is venerated through serpent hood idols.
* **Jhankalai** represents a living snake deity revered in specific villages.
* **Bannagini** is regarded as a snake born from a human mother.

Other regional practices include the worship of **Brahmani** (identified with Manasa in Katwa) and **Kshoichera Puja** in Purulia, illustrating the multifaceted nature of her cult.



## Mythology and Origins

### Hardhaddi Manasa

In North Bengal, particularly Cooch Behar, Manasa is revered as **Hardhaddi Manasa** ("Bone-Joining Manasa"). This title arises from a tale in the *Manasamangal* epic: When Behula floated her deceased husband Lakhindar’s body to Indrapuri, a boal fish had devoured one of his legs. Shiva recovered the leg and reattached it with mantras, while Manasa’s blessings restored his life. The **Madanmohan Bari** in Cooch Behar commemorates this event annually during the Shravan Sankranti festival, highlighting her power to heal and revive.

### Saitan and Manasa

A folk myth in North Bengal features **Saitan**, a barren woman blessed by Manasa with two sons after vowing to worship her (as Bishahari) at their weddings. When Saitan neglected this vow, Manasa killed her sons but later revived them. This narrative underpins the Rajbanshi tradition of singing *Manasa Panchali* devotional songs before weddings to appease the goddess.

### Bannagini

In Kalipahari’s Kalitikuri village (Bardhaman), a legend tells of **Yash Ginnir**, a pregnant woman who gave birth to a snake instead of a child. This snake, **Bannagini** ("Forest Serpent"), is worshipped as a form of Manasa. Bannagini is honored annually on Nag Panchami at the Bannaginitola temple, where fairs and animal sacrifices occur.

### Jhankalai

**Jhankalai** is a living snake deity venerated in South 24 Parganas villages such as Musar, Chhotopolala, Boropolala, and Polsona. These snakes measure three to four feet, have distinctive black and blue patterns, short tails, and a wheel-like mark on their hoods. Only the Chakraborty family priests handle them, releasing them unharmed. Their bites are believed non-lethal if treated with soil from the temple and seeking Manasa’s forgiveness. Jhankalai snakes are said to consume other snakes and frogs (called *naru* locally), protecting the villages. During pujas, the snakes reportedly accept offerings by sitting before them.

### Brahmani as Manasa

In Katwa, Manasa is identified with **Brahmani**, one of seven sister goddesses. According to myth, Brahmani appeared in a dream to a Majumdar in Chanduli village, declaring herself and her six sisters as deities. Unable to bear their burden, the sisters dispersed across seven locations in the Radh region, including Chanduli, Kalipahari, and the Ganges’ mouth. Brahmani’s worship features the **Beeichili** ritual — a boat procession with three sisters taken to the river for seven circuits during a Saturday in the dark fortnight. Brahmani’s stone idol in Kalipahari is seated on a swan, while in other villages brass pots symbolize her presence.

### Manasa’s Birth Myth

A myth from South 24 Parganas narrates Manasa’s origin from Shiva’s semen, which fell on a lotus leaf during his visit to Mukti Lake and was consumed by a serpent. The serpent, unable to bear it, consulted Vasuki, who took her to Kashyap Muni. Following his advice, the semen was expelled, giving birth to Manasa. Shiva recognized her as his daughter and hid her in a Kali temple. Parvati, enraged by Narad’s revelation, attacked Manasa, blinding one eye. Manasa asserted her innocence, claiming divine kinship with Parvati’s children Ganesha and Kartik, symbolizing her contested divine status and incorporation into the Shaivite pantheon.



## Worship and Rituals

### Hardhaddi Manasa

At the Madanmohan Bari in Cooch Behar, Hardhaddi Manasa’s puja on Shravan Sankranti involves offerings commemorating her healing role. Rajbanshi communities sing *Manasa Panchali* before weddings for protection and blessings.

### Jhankalai

In Musar village, Jhankalai is worshipped both as a living snake and through a stone idol discovered in Khunedanga pond centuries ago. The Nag Panchami puja includes the **Kshirakolosh Yatra**, where turmeric and milk-filled clay pots representing male and female snakes are decorated and carried to the pond with traditional music. The pots are broken, fragments buried or gathered by villagers, believed to protect against venomous snakes. The event includes fairs, singing of *Letogan* devotional songs, and dramas.

### Bannagini

At the Bannaginitola temple in Kalipahari, Bannagini’s Nag Panchami puja involves animal sacrifices and a fair, honoring the snake goddess as a protector.

### Brahmani

The **Beeichili** boat ritual in Chanduli village involves the Bhattacharya family organizing the puja with drummers and prohibitions on cooking prior to the event. Devotees partake in vegetarian meals such as roasted rice. Brahmani’s stone idol in Kalipahari and brass pots in other villages form the focus of worship.

### South 24 Parganas Practices

Manasa is worshipped through clay serpent hood idols with seven, nine, or forty-two hoods, especially by communities who migrated from Khulna and Barisal. The **Basundhara Puja** features offerings to these idols. The *Manasa Pala* narrative songs recount stories of Chashi Mahadev (Shiva as a farmer) and emphasize his purification after contact with Revati Kuchni, leading to Manasa’s birth.

### Kshoichera Puja

In Purulia, the **Kshoichera Puja** is observed in Shravan on Tuesdays or Saturdays. A branch from the Manasa tree is planted at a tulsi altar, decorated with hibiscus and karabi flowers. Household work and rice consumption are stopped; devotees eat flattened rice and curd. At night, *Bishom Dhak* (venom drum) music accompanies Manasamangal songs narrating Manasa’s tales.

### Narayan Dubey

In Santhal Pargana, Narayan Dubey, a Brahmin *ojha* (snakebite healer), is venerated posthumously as a deity. Mahadev instructed villagers to build his shrine, promising protection from snakebites for those who first seek his help. His puja during Shravan includes tamarind tree rituals, optional animal sacrifices, and obligatory kheer offerings. Priests may undergo possession (*cheta*), during which they are called *chetira*.

### Kangkchandi

In Mangalkot’s Kakoura and Salar’s Kangkchandi, Manasa is worshipped as **Kangkchandi**, linked to the historical Kanggram of Lakshman Sen’s time. The puja involves traditional offerings and songs, underscoring her regional importance.

### Golsi’s Champai

In Golsi (now Kasba), Chand Saudagar is credited with starting Manasa’s puja, commemorated at the Jahapur Bhattacharya household during Durga Puja’s Navami. Black goat sacrifice is unique to this tradition, established over 300 years ago. The village forbids *Jhapana* songs and Baul performances, maintaining ritual purity.


## Temples and Sacred Sites

* **Madanmohan Bari, Cooch Behar** – Center of Hardhaddi Manasa worship during Shravan Sankranti.
* **Bannaginitola Temple, Kalipahari** – Dedicated to Bannagini with annual Nag Panchami fairs.
* **Musar Temple, South 24 Parganas** – Houses Jhankalai’s stone idol and living snakes.
* **Chanduli, Kalipahari, and other Radh villages** – Sites of Brahmani’s puja, featuring brass pots or stone idols.
* **Jahapur Bhattacharya Household, Golsi** – Hosts Manasa’s puja during Durga Puja.
* **Narayan Dubey Shrines, Santhal Pargana** – Associated with snakebite protection rituals.


## Cultural Significance

Manasa’s folk worship illustrates Bengal’s syncretic religious landscape, blending Hindu mythology with animistic beliefs. The myth of Hardhaddi Manasa emphasizes life restoration, while Jhankalai as a living deity highlights nature reverence. Bannagini’s origin story integrates human-divine connections. Brahmani’s boat rituals symbolize riverine ties. The prohibition of certain cultural forms in Golsi reflects localized notions of ritual purity. Pujas like Kshoichera and Kangkchandi emphasize Manasa’s crucial role in protecting agrarian communities from snakebite threats.


## Historical Context

Manasa’s folk forms derive from a mix of Vedic, tantric, and local tribal traditions. Jhankalai’s association with the Mahayana Buddhist goddess Janguli is documented in texts like *Sadhana Mala*. The *Manasamangal* epic has heavily influenced worship practices, while historical figures such as Lakshman Sen and local healers like Narayan Dubey have contributed to evolving ritual customs. Post-Partition migration notably brought Khulna-Barisal snake goddess traditions into South 24 Parganas, ensuring continuity.
