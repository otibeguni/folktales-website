# Masan (folk deities)

**Masan** (Bengali: মাসান) are a group of local deities and spirits venerated in the folk religion of northern West Bengal, especially in the districts of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri. They are often seen as associated with death, disease, and protection against malevolent forces. Masan worship is part of a syncretic folk tradition blending elements of Shakta, Shaiva, and animist beliefs.


### Mythological Origins

There are multiple folk narratives concerning the origin of the Masan deities:

* One origin myth tells that while the goddess Kali was dancing in ecstasy at a place called Teghata in Natabari (Tufanganj), drops of her sweat fell to the earth. Each drop gave rise to a Masan: including Damsha, Chuchia, Bishua, Obua, Chalan, Bohita, and Narha Masan.
* Another tale suggests that Masan is the eldest son among the eighteen children of the goddess Kali.
* A third myth claims that the deity Pichla Masan was born from the union of Kali and Dharma Thakur, when the latter surprised Kali while she bathed alone in a pond.


### Number and Types of Masan

While folklorist Charuchandra Sanyal lists 16 different Masans, local traditions in Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri mention up to 24. Some named Masan deities include:

* **Jaluya Masan** (linked to water spirits)
* **Garkata**, **Tosha**, **Ghughra**, **Chhapila**, **Khyataora**, **Pora**, **Bhyara**
* **Gadadhar**, **Kana**, **Kuchiyamari**, **Shura**, **Sundarmala**, **Nishinda**
* **Yakkha Masan**, **Mahadev Masan**, **Kali Masan**, **Murya**, **Shoshan Masan**
* **Singha Masan**, **Ghora Masan**, **Hati Masan**, **Kachhap Masan**

Folklorist Girijashankar Roy mentions 18 variants of Masan in his writings.


### Symptoms of Possession and Ritual Healing

Masan deities are feared for their association with spirit possession and illness. Affliction often occurs on Saturdays, Tuesdays, or Amavasya (new moon nights), and may involve:

* Sudden fever, body ache, or hallucinations
* Compulsive behavior such as sleepwalking, collecting fish at night, or eating burnt clay
* Strange dreams involving fish or fire
* Gradual physical and mental deterioration

Upon symptoms of possession, the afflicted person is taken to a **Masan Thaan**—a shrine that may be a tin-roofed structure or a tree-based altar—where ritual healing is performed by a local *Ojha* or *Adhikari purohit* (folk priest).


### Worship and Iconography

Masan worship typically involves:

* Offerings of roasted rice, clay lamps, fermented rice, fish (especially shol), bananas, yogurt, and pigeons
* Ritual chants to invoke Kali and Masan
* Use of symbolic flags and earthen pots

Masan idols vary widely in form. Common features include:

* Dark or blue skin, wild hair, headbands, large moustaches, bulging eyes, fat bellies, and weapons like maces
* Some Masans ride unusual mounts such as elephants, turtles, shol fish, or sheep
* Unique forms include **Nikhinda Masan**, a headless deity with eyes on its chest


### Notable Local Variants

* **Tosha Masan** (Dangboka, Mathabhanga): has dual animal mounts—fish and pig.
* **Nanga Masan**: appears nude; sighting him leads to immediate death.
* **Chalan Masan**: resides near roadside vegetation; attacks passersby.
* **Kuhuliya Masan**: sings to lure victims, mimicking a koel bird.
* **Bohita Masan**: lives in banana trunks floating in water.
* **Murya or Nikhinda Masan**: headless, eyes on torso; active in Natabari and Thetar Paat.
* **Vula Masan** and **Cholna Masan**: deceive victims through illusion or persuasion.
* **Barika Masan**: punishes households near forest edges.
* **Damsha Masan**: most active at night; haunts forest dwellings.
* **Obua Masan**: causes vomiting and gastrointestinal distress.
* **Nera Masan**: bald-headed, contrasted with Kolir Masan.
* **Shura Masan**: particularly venerated in the Shikarpur area.


### Cultural Significance

Masan deities straddle the boundary between fearsome spirits and protective local gods. Their worship, while not always part of mainstream Hinduism, plays a significant role in local healing traditions, especially in rural areas of North Bengal. They are also linked to ecological landmarks such as forests, ponds, fields, and cremation grounds.
