# **Buri**

**Buri** (Bengali: বুড়ি) refers to a diverse class of ancient regional mother goddesses venerated across parts of eastern India, especially in **West Bengal** and **Jharkhand**. The term *"Buri"* does **not** denote an elderly woman, but symbolizes an **ancestral, matriarchal, protective deity** rooted in **pre-Vedic**, **tribal**, and **agrarian traditions**. These goddesses are associated with **fertility, health, prosperity**, and **village safety**.


## Geographic Distribution

Buri worship is mainly found in:

* **West Bengal**: Bardhaman, Birbhum, Bankura, Purulia
* **Jharkhand**: Dhanbad, Dumka

Shrines, known as **"Buri’r Thaan"**, are usually located on village outskirts—near rivers, fields, or sacred groves—emphasizing their connection to **nature** and **local ecology**.



## Iconography and Worship Practices

Most Buri shrines **lack anthropomorphic images**. Instead, devotees worship:

* A **cemented altar**
* A **mound of earth**
* A **simple stone slab**

These are often shaded by trees and seen as sacred. Rituals blend **animist** and **Hindu elements**.



### Votive Offerings and Ritual Objects

A defining feature of Buri worship includes:

* **Terracotta horses and elephants** (symbolic vehicles)
* **Alcohol offerings** (e.g., for Bidh Buri)

> Only males may consume *prasad*, and only while **standing** at the shrine.
