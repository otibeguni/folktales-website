# Irbhanath

**Irbhanath** (Bengali: ইরভানাথ) is a regional folk deity venerated primarily in **Deuli village**, located in **Bagmundi, Purulia district, West Bengal, India**. Worshipped mostly by **tribal and rural communities**, Irbhanath is believed to be a **localized transformation of a Jain Tirthankara**, whose original identity evolved through centuries of **cultural shifts, oral transmission, and religious syncretism**.

## Etymology and Name Evolution

The name **Irbhanath** is thought to be a **folk-evolved** form of *Arnath*, recorded by **J.D. Beglar** during his 19th-century survey of the region.

* **Beglar (1872–73):** Recorded the name *Arnath*
* **McCutchion (1972):** Later documented the same idol as *Irbhanath*

This shift reflects **oral-linguistic evolution** in local traditions.



## Historical Background

### Early Jain Influence

The region of **Rarh Bengal** (Purulia, Bankura, Bardhaman) was historically important for **Jainism**, especially between the **2nd and 4th centuries BCE**.

* Jain texts suggest **Mahavira** may have passed through this area
* Archaeological finds include **Jain temples, chaityas, and sculptures**

### Decline and Religious Assimilation

As **Brahmanical Hinduism** rose during the medieval period:

* Jainism declined
* Abandoned Jain icons were **absorbed into local practices**
* Many Jain idols were **renamed** and **revered as Hindu or tribal deities**



## The Deuli Temples

The **Irbhanath idol** is housed in a **north-facing temple** in Deuli, part of a **cluster of five temples** documented by Beglar.

* Central temple faced **north**
* Two temples were **in ruins**
* The **black stone idol** included a **deer motif**, typical of Jain symbolism

### McCutchion’s Observations

* **Deer symbol** confirmed Jain origin
* Worship led by a **tribal priest**
* The idol was renamed **Irbhanath** and seen as a **fertility deity**



## Iconography

* **Height:** \~3 feet
* **Material:** Dark stone
* **Symbols:**

  * **Deer** on pedestal — Jain emblem
  * A separate **four-armed idol** under a **kusum tree**:

    * Weapons: sword, mace, ankusha (goad), scimitar
    * Reflects **Hindu assimilation**



## Worship and Rituals

### Devotional Practices

Primarily worshipped by **women** for **fertility**, especially during **Jaishtha Sankranti**.

#### Rituals Include:

* **Bathing Ritual:** Women bathe in a nearby pond the night before Sankranti
* **Divination:** Objects in hand predict future child’s gender
* **Vow (Manat):** Fulfilled wishes are honored with offerings
* **Animal Sacrifice:** Goats offered—reflecting Hindu syncretism
* **Annual Fair:** Held during Jaishtha Sankranti, attracts large crowds



## Scholarly Interpretation

Irbhanath is seen as a **religious palimpsest**:

* A Jain **Tirthankara** gradually **reinterpreted** as a folk god
* Illustrates:

  * **Fluid religious identities**
  * **Syncretic layering** of tribal, Jain, and Hindu traditions
  * **Linguistic transformation**: Arnath → Irbhanath



## Cultural Significance

Irbhanath represents:

* The **persistence of Jain heritage** in rural Bengal
* **Syncretic religious rituals** over centuries
* The **important role of women** in sustaining religious customs
