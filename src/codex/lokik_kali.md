# Folk Deity Kali (লোকিক কালী)

**Kali** is a regional folk form of the Hindu goddess worshipped primarily in parts of northern West Bengal and Cooch Behar. This manifestation of Kali is associated with agrarian traditions, local legends, and unique ritual practices distinct from classical temple worship. Various villages in the region observe annual Kali Puja festivities centered around this deity, combining both folk beliefs and Brahmanical influences.

## Temple and Iconography

A notable temple dedicated to Mother Kali stands approximately 30 feet tall and contains eight metal objects inside, including a sword, scissors, a mirror, and a plow. The idol is uniquely worshipped by placing a round stone slab at the base of a tree, inscribed with the name of the goddess Kamakhya. This stone slab itself is venerated alongside the idol, representing the deity's presence in natural elements.

## Local Legends

### The Basket Seller and the Red-bordered Saree Girl

A popular folk tale explains the origin of the Madhai Khal Kali temple. According to the story, a bamboo basket seller resting in Patharson village was approached by a girl dressed in a red-bordered saree who wished to buy a basket. After selecting a basket, she left without paying. Upon calling her back, she explained she had no money but instructed him to collect the price from her father, Sharan Barman, near Bamanhat market.

When the seller approached Sharan Chandra Babu, he denied having a daughter and was initially incredulous. After some discussion, Sharan Babu paid for the basket. In honor of this event, a temple to Bhadra Kali was built at the location where the basket seller first saw the girl. This temple is now known as the Madhai Khal Kali temple.

## Rituals and Festivals

### Madhai Khal Kali Puja

Each year, the Madhai Khal Kali temple hosts a fair during Kali Puja lasting twelve days. Traditional practices include married women offering new bamboo baskets (called shikha) in front of the temple. The community believes that consuming the soil from jute fields and tulsi leaves blessed by this Kali cures diseases and restores health.

### Manokshamna Kali Puja

In Palika village of Trifangapuz, the Kaliganga wetland historically lacked water until it was filled following the blessings of Mother Kali. After the goddess appeared in a dream instructing the locals to initiate Kali Puja there, the Manokshamna Kali Puja became an annual ritual.

### Masankali Puja in Cooch Behar

In Balasi village near Dewanhat, Cooch Behar, a unique form of idol-less Kali Puja takes place. A performer (a dancer) is seated beneath a banyan tree and worshipped as Masankali, a fierce form of Kali. Despite the absence of an idol, the ritual concludes with the immersion of an idol before dawn, adhering to traditional practices.

### Other Regional Kali Worship

* In Morichbari village of Cooch Behar, a folk form named Shakhati Devi is worshipped every Diapanvita Amavasya (new moon night).
* On the Amavasya of the Bhadra month, Chinnamasta Kali Puja at Sahebganj in Dinhata and Baussmari Kali Puja in Baussmari village are significant regional observances.

## Cultural Significance

The folk Kali worship in these regions is an expression of the veneration of Matrikas (mother goddesses) in various local forms. These practices blend male and female cosmic energies, where male energy is symbolized by power and female energy by nature or the mother principle. The goddess Kali in these traditions represents the maternal and protective force integral to community health, fertility, and agrarian prosperity.
