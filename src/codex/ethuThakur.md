# Enthu Thakur and Gorbhoy Thakur Worship in West Bengal and Jharkhand Border Regions

**Enthu Thakur** and **Gorbhoy Thakur** are revered as *kuldevtas* (family or clan deities) by the Badyakar-Dom and other scheduled caste communities living along the border regions of West Bengal and Jharkhand. These folk deities are worshipped alongside **Mansa Devi**, the serpent goddess, and are believed to wield significant power, with the potential to bring prosperity or calamity if not properly propitiated. The worship practices involve unique rituals, animal sacrifices, and offerings that reflect the cultural and spiritual traditions of these communities. The rituals are deeply tied to local folklore and the agrarian lifestyle, emphasizing protection and appeasement of these deities.

#### Enthu Thakur Worship
**Enthu Thakur**, also known as **Etu Thakur**, is a distinctive folk deity worshipped primarily by the Badyakar-Dom community in the border villages of West Bengal and Jharkhand. The deity’s name, meaning "used" or "partially consumed" (*enṭho*), derives from the unique practice of offering partially consumed food and items by the priest (*purohit*).

- **Shrine Description**: The *than* (shrine) of Enthu Thakur consists of three red-painted, cement-bound, circular mounds flanked by two white horse statues. Rows of clay horses, offered as votive offerings (*manat*), are placed at the shrine, along with a trident (*trishul*), symbolizing the deity’s power.
- **Ritual Timing**: The puja is held annually on the first day of Ashwin (mid-September to mid-October), the day after the Mansa Puja during Bhadra Sankranti.
- **Ritual Practices**:
  - **Priest’s Attire and Preparation**: The priest dresses in a bright red cloth, a red headband (*pheti*), and a gamcha (towel) wrapped around the waist. The priest wears garlands made of potato chops (*alur chop*), whole fruits, and onions, and a pouch of country liquor (*tufaan*) around the neck. Before the puja, the priest looks into a mirror and combs their hair using items placed in a ceremonial tray (*baran dala*).
  - **Offerings**: The shrine is adorned with wild turmeric flowers (*jungli holud phul*), vermilion (*sindur*), a mirror, red clothing, a comb, and country liquor (*tufaan*). Additional offerings include fried eggplants (*beguni*), potato chops, and even cigarettes.
  - **Unique Ritual**: The priest chants incomprehensible mantras while making sounds with iron tongs (*chimte*). The priest bites into the potato chops from the garland and offers these partially consumed (*enṭho*) chops to Enthu Thakur. Similarly, the priest lights a cigarette, takes a few puffs, and offers the partially smoked cigarette to the deity. This act of offering partially consumed items is exclusive to the priest, and no one else’s *enṭho* offerings are accepted, as doing so is believed to invite calamity.
  - **Possession**: During the puja, the priest may become possessed by Enthu Thakur, believed to enhance the ritual’s spiritual potency.
  - **Prasad Distribution**: The prasad includes fried testicles of a goat sacrificed during the Mansa Puja, rice, curry, puffed rice (*muri*), potato chops, and country liquor. The prasad is distributed among devotees but must be consumed at the worship site.
- **Cultural Significance**: Enthu Thakur’s worship is unique for its use of *enṭho* offerings, reflecting the deity’s distinct identity and the community’s belief in its protective and vengeful nature. The emphasis on the priest’s exclusive role in offering partially consumed items underscores the deity’s strict ritual boundaries. The puja is seen as essential to prevent misfortunes like fever (*jur*) or epidemics (*jari*) sent by an angered Enthu Thakur.

#### Gorbhoy Thakur Worship
**Gorbhoy Thakur** is the protector deity of Kar village in Jharkhand, worshipped by scheduled caste communities as a *kuldevta*. The deity is revered for safeguarding the village and ensuring prosperity, with rituals centered around agricultural and communal well-being.

- **Ritual Timing**: The puja is held annually on the first day of Magh (mid-January).
- **Ritual Practices**:
  - **Offerings**: The shrine is adorned with vermilion, parboiled rice (*atap chal*), sacred thread (*poita*), alta (red dye), fruits, and sweets. The primary *bhog* (offering) is kheer (*payes*), a rice pudding.
  - **Animal Sacrifice and Evening Ritual**: Before the evening puja (*sandhya puja*), goats and pigs are sacrificed. The tongues of the sacrificed pigs are cut and buried in a pit on the eastern side of the shrine, along with copper and silver coins and tulsi leaves. The priest pours country liquor into the pit during this ritual. The liquor is considered prasad and is consumed exclusively by the priest’s family.
  - **Prasad Distribution**: The head of the sacrificed goat is cooked with rice to make khichuri, which is distributed as prasad to all devotees. The prasad must be consumed at the worship site, as taking it home is prohibited.
- **Cultural Significance**: Gorbhoy Thakur’s worship emphasizes agricultural prosperity and community protection. The burial of pig tongues with coins and liquor reflects a ritualistic offering to appease the deity and ensure the village’s safety. The restriction on taking prasad home underscores the sanctity of the worship site.

#### Cultural and Social Context
The worship of Enthu Thakur and Gorbhoy Thakur is deeply embedded in the socio-cultural fabric of the Badyakar-Dom and other scheduled caste communities along the West Bengal-Jharkhand border. These practices highlight:
- **Syncretism and Local Identity**: Both deities are worshipped alongside Mansa Devi, reflecting a blend of tribal and Hindu traditions. The use of country liquor, cigarettes, and potato chops in Enthu Thakur’s puja, and pig sacrifices in Gorbhoy Thakur’s worship, indicate the integration of local customs into religious practices.
- **Role of Priests and Mediums**: The priests play a central role, with Enthu Thakur’s rituals requiring the priest’s exclusive participation in *enṭho* offerings, and Gorbhoy Thakur’s puja involving specific priestly families for liquor consumption. Possession during Enthu Thakur’s puja further emphasizes the priest’s role as a spiritual intermediary.
- **Community Beliefs**: The fear of Enthu Thakur’s wrath, manifested as fever or epidemics, and the protective role of Gorbhoy Thakur underscore the deities’ perceived power over the community’s well-being. These beliefs are tied to the agrarian lifestyle, where livestock and crops are central to survival.
- **Ritual Exclusivity**: The strict rules against non-priests offering *enṭho* items to Enthu Thakur and the prohibition on taking Gorbhoy Thakur’s prasad home reflect the deities’ sacred boundaries and the importance of ritual purity.

#### Comparison with Other Folk Deities
Enthu Thakur and Gorbhoy Thakur share similarities with other folk deities like **Mahangiri**, **Minha Samni**, and **Mahadana**, worshipped in the Subarnarekha region, where vermilion and kohl markings on walls or stones replace traditional idols. However, Enthu Thakur’s unique *enṭho* offerings and Gorbhoy Thakur’s pig tongue burial ritual distinguish them from these practices. The emphasis on country liquor and modern items like cigarettes in Enthu Thakur’s puja reflects a contemporary adaptation of folk worship, while Gorbhoy Thakur’s rituals align closely with agricultural cycles, similar to Mahadana.
