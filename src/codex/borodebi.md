# **Boro Debi**

**Boro Debi** (Bengali: বড়োদেবী), also known as *Bhagavati*, is a regional manifestation of the Hindu goddess Durga, venerated primarily by the **Koch Rajbanshi** community in **Cooch Behar**, West Bengal, India. Worshipped at the **Debibari Temple**, Boro Debi is at the center of one of the oldest and most distinctive **Durga Puja** traditions in Bengal. The deity’s iconography and associated rituals reflect a unique blend of **Brahmanical and indigenous folk traditions**, showcasing the syncretic religious culture of the Koch kingdom.

## History and Origins

The worship of Boro Debi is traditionally attributed to **King Naranarayan** (r. 1540–1587) of the **Koch dynasty** and his brother **Bir Chilarai (Shukladhvaj)**. Historical and oral accounts suggest that during a military expedition to Assam around 1562, Naranarayan conducted a **Brahmanical Durga Puja** at the banks of the **Sankosh River** (near present-day Chamta village, Tufanganj). According to legend, the goddess appeared to him and instructed that she be worshipped in both **Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical** modes. Upon his return, Naranarayan institutionalized this dual-tradition puja at Cooch Behar.

Folk traditions recorded in *Rajopakhyan* by **Joynath Munshi** recount that the young Naranarayan once crafted a Durga idol from **bamboo and Mayna tree branches**, possibly foreshadowing his later religious innovations. Some historians assert that Boro Debi Puja predates other notable Durga Pujas in Bengal, including that of **Kangsanarayan of Taherpur** (initiated circa 1580).

## Iconography

The iconography of Boro Debi significantly deviates from classical portrayals of Durga:

* **Complexion:** She is depicted with a **deep red skin tone** and **large, striking eyes**.
* **Arms and Attributes:** The goddess bears **ten arms**, wielding traditional weapons such as a **trident, sword, arrow, spear, shield, noose, bow, axe, goad**, and **staff**.
* **Vahana (Mounts):** She stands flanked by **both a lion and a tiger**, symbolizing her dual ferocity.
* **Attendants:** Unlike mainstream Durga depictions with her children, she is accompanied by **Jaya and Vijaya**, two divine attendants.
* **Demon:** The demon she slays is painted **dark green** and is pierced by her trident.

This iconography is elaborated in the genealogy of **Gandharva Narayan**, a Koch royal relative, who described her as “ten-armed, youthful, three-eyed, with her right foot on a lion and left on a buffalo.”

## Debibari Temple

The **Debibari Temple** in Cooch Behar, constructed in **1915–1916**, serves as the principal shrine for Boro Debi. Replacing earlier thatched structures, the temple reflects a fusion of **Koch architectural heritage** and colonial influences, featuring **eight Corinthian-style pillars**, a **triangular pediment**, and **iron latticework**. The temple measures **51 feet 6 inches** by **29 feet 9 inches**, with a height of **33 feet**.

## Rituals and Practices

The **Boro Debi Puja** is notable for its **inclusive, syncretic rites**, allowing participation across caste lines and integrating both Brahmanical and tribal elements.

### Preparatory Rituals

* **Yupa Installation:** On the Shukla Ashtami of the month of **Shravana**, a **Mayna tree branch** (7.5 hands in length) is cut and consecrated as a **sacrificial post (yupa)**. It is initially worshipped at the **Dangar-Aai Temple**, then kept at the **Madanmohan Temple**, and finally taken to the Debibari Temple for ritual bathing (**Mahasnan**) and the **Dharmapatha Puja**.
* **Clay Collection:** Clay for the idol is collected from **Chamta village**, believed to be where the goddess appeared. The **Chitrakar community** performs the collection after offering **red and white flowers** and sacrificing a **pigeon**.

### Main Festival (Pratipada to Dashami)

* **Mahalaya:** The painting of the deity’s eyes marks the formal beginning of the puja.
* **Pratipada:** A **copper kalasha** is installed. **Panchagrami Brahmins**, descendants of five Brahmin families settled by Naranarayan, perform **homa** and recite **mantras** throughout the festival.
* **Shashthi:** A **silver Hanuman staff** is brought from the Madanmohan Temple. A royal representative performs **Deo Dekha**, viewing the goddess through a **bilva leaf**, and purifies **four bilva fruits**.
* **Saptami:** The **“Tanatani”** ritual, involving the pulling of the deity’s iron platform, recreates the earlier practice of moving the idol between thatched temples. The **Navapatrika** (nine sacred plants) is worshipped as **“Bilyabarana.”**
* **Ashtami:** Features **eight prahara pujas**. The **Rajbanshi community** worships the Hanuman staff and conducts **Chaliya Bahu** and **Gupta Dhara** rituals. The latter, once involving **human sacrifice**, is now symbolized by offering a **rice flour head** with **blood drops** from the **Kachari clan**, alongside a **buffalo sacrifice**.
* **Navami:** A **magur fish** is sacrificed.
* **Dashami:** The idol is dismembered and immersed in the **Yamuna Dighi** (Long Damba). Historically, the **kalasha** was taken to the palace for **Aparajita Puja**, and royal arms were worshipped in **Yatra Shastra Puja** (discontinued in 1959). The Rajbanshi community offers a **pig sacrifice**.

### Historical Practices

Several historical practices have since been discontinued:

* **Khanjan Bird Release:** A **khanjan bird** was released on Dashami to foretell the kingdom’s fortune.
* **Dashera Shobhayatra:** From 1945–1949, the Maharaja led an **immersion procession** known as the “Dashera Shobhayatra.”

## Administration

The Boro Debi Puja is currently overseen by the **Debottar Trust Board**, with the **royal representative** (**Deo Bagchi**) playing a central role in organizing the rituals.

## Cultural Significance

Boro Debi Puja represents a rare example of **religious syncretism** in Bengal, blending **tribal, Tantric**, and **Vedic** elements under royal patronage. The festival unites communities across caste boundaries and is deeply embedded in the **cultural and political legacy** of the Koch dynasty. Its antiquity, unique iconography, and folk-influenced rites make it a significant subject of study for historians, anthropologists, and religious scholars.

## Related Traditions

Several other regional deities and rituals are linked to the worship of Boro Debi:

* **Bhavani Devi** at the **Madanmohan Temple** is a miniature form of Boro Debi.
* **Katyayani Devi**, also at the Madanmohan Temple, is depicted piercing a demon attacked by both a **lion and a tiger**. Her puja takes place during **Ras Purnima** in **Kartik**.
* The **Kathamiya Durga Puja** held at the Madanmohan Temple also shares iconographic and ritual similarities.
