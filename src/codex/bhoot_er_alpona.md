# Bhooter Alpana

**Bhooter Alpana** refers to a traditional form of ritualistic **floor art (alpana)** associated with the worship or invocation of spirits and ghosts in parts of West Bengal, particularly in the **Haora (Howrah) district**.

## Overview

Contrary to popular misconceptions that **Bhooter Alpana** might be linked merely to ghost stories or superstitions involving offerings like "Choddoshak" (a traditional 14-leaf vegetable dish) or lighting lamps in dark corners, this folk art has a distinct cultural and ritual significance.

## Cultural Significance and Practice

In various villages of Howrah district, **Brahmin and Kayastha couples** (husband and wife pairs) create **Bhooter Alpana** depicting the arrival of spirits. The traditional motif shows a male and female ghost riding in a palanquin ("palki") descending from the spiritual realm (referred to as "Bomalay" or the ghost world) to the earthly realm.

* The palanquin is carried by several other disembodied spirits.
* The female ghost is depicted wearing **sindoor** (vermilion) on her forehead, symbolizing her marital status.

This alpana is initially drawn in the **kitchen**, a sacred place for household rituals. Subsequently, similar designs are made in other parts of the house, including:

* Bedrooms
* Cowsheds (Gowal ghar)
* Both sides of doorways

This placement underscores the ritualistic importance and the intent to invoke or honor these spirits respectfully throughout the home.

## Artistic Elements

The **Bhooter Alpana** uses traditional motifs and lines to represent the spirits and their palanquin procession. It serves both an artistic and symbolic purpose, blending folk religious beliefs with everyday household life.

## Ritual Context

While the precise festival or occasion linked to the creation of Bhooter Alpana is not detailed here, it likely coincides with local observances of ancestral or spirit worship, typical in rural Bengal.
