# **Tiger and Elephant Guardian Deities in Tripuri Folk Religion**

In the folk religion of Tripura and neighboring regions of northeastern India and Bangladesh, a number of deities associated with **tigers and elephants** are worshipped by various tribal and syncretic communities. These **animal guardian spirits**—such as **Gazi Kalu**, **Shonirao Motai**, and **Longtorai Motai**—are primarily worshipped to ward off wild animal attacks, protect livestock, and maintain harmony with nature. Although not part of daily religious life, these deities receive **annual sacrificial offerings**, typically outside the home and in forest-adjacent or communal spaces.



## **Gazi Kalu**

**Gazi Kalu** is a prominent folk deity among the **Kaklu (Khaklu)** community, particularly those settled around **Tulsi Hill (Tulsiparbat)**. He is perceived both as a **malevolent spirit** (*opodevota*) and a **guardian deity**, especially against tiger attacks. Gazi Kalu is often associated with the *Fakir* or *Jinn* lineage in local belief systems, indicating Islamic folkloric influences.

Gazi Kalu is venerated for two main reasons:

1. **To protect humans from wild animal attacks**, especially tigers and wild boars.
2. **To safeguard livestock** from mysterious deaths or disappearances attributed to his wrath.

Though not worshipped daily, Gazi Kalu receives an **annual sacrifice**, usually a **he-goat**, to appease him. This ritual typically takes place on a **Saturday or Tuesday** during the Bengali months of **Asharh (June–July)** or **Bhadra (August–September)**. A Hindu priest (*purohit*) usually performs the rites.

Gazi Kalu is also connected to the **broader South Asian tiger deity tradition**, including:

* **Dakshin Rai** of the Sundarbans (West Bengal)
* **Shonirao Motai** and **Longtorai Motai** of northern Tripura and adjoining regions


## **Shonirao Motai**

**Shonirao Motai** is revered as a **tiger deity** among multiple Tripuri subgroups, including the **Uchoi**, **Kaklu**, **Jamatia**, **Noatia**, **Riang**, and **Debbarma** communities. He is seen as the ruling spirit of tigers and is worshipped to prevent tiger attacks on humans and cattle.

As with Gazi Kalu, worship of Shonirao Motai is not part of everyday household ritual. Instead, a **yearly sacrificial ceremony** is held, generally outside the home, with offerings like goats or chickens made to appease him and ensure protection.


## **Longtorai Motai**

**Longtorai Motai** is the **guardian spirit of elephants**, worshipped especially in regions of Tripura where **elephant-human conflict** is common. Just like Shonirao Motai, he is honored annually with animal sacrifice and other offerings to prevent elephant raids on crops and villages.

Longtorai Motai is one of the few deities explicitly associated with elephants in South Asian folk belief, underscoring the unique ecological setting of Tripura.



## **Baghai (Baghai Upo-devota)**

Among **Tripura's Bengali communities**, a similar guardian spirit named **Baghai**, or the "Tiger Sub-deity", is worshipped. This reflects the syncretism of indigenous tribal traditions with Bengali folk Hinduism. Baghai functions similarly to Shonirao Motai, acting as a spiritual protector against tigers and jungle threats.



## **Ritual Practice and Community Involvement**

These deities are:

* **Not worshipped daily**
* **Not given space inside homes**
* **Honored once a year**, typically during agriculturally sensitive months or periods of high wildlife activity

The rituals are often conducted by **community priests** and attended collectively by the village or clan group. Offerings include:

* **Animal sacrifice** (commonly goats or roosters)
* **Fruits**
* **Liquor**
* **Sacred grasses** (*durba*)

Their worship reflects a broader **animist worldview**, where harmony with wild nature—especially dangerous animals like tigers and elephants—is maintained through ritual negotiation.
