# Harima and Putkuni Masi Puja

The **Harima Puja** and **Putkuni Masi Puja** are traditional Hindu worship ceremonies dedicated to unique manifestations of deities in West Bengal and Jharkhand, India. Harima, worshipped as a form of Goddess Durga, and Putkuni Masi, a tantric wish-fulfilling deity, hold significant cultural and religious importance in their respective regions. These pujas blend local folklore, divine visions, and community-driven rituals, reflecting the spiritual heritage of the areas.

## Harima Puja

### Origins and History

The Harima Puja originated in Katwa, West Bengal, at Mandal Pond, initiated through the efforts of two women from the Hari clan, Shyamasundari and Binodini, with financial support from a *dewan* (official) of King Krishnachandra Roy of Nadia. The puja was established to worship Mother Durga as **Harima**, a deity revered in a simple, accessible form.

Following the deaths of the *dewan*, Shyamasundari, and Binodini, the responsibility of the puja fell to Bhuban Hazra, a descendant of Shyamasundari. After Bhuban’s death, his wife, Saudamini, faced severe financial difficulties, making it challenging to continue the puja. In despair, Saudamini prayed to Harima. One day, a young girl appeared at her doorstep, requesting food. With only leftover rice (*panta bhat*) to offer, Saudamini hesitantly served it to the girl, who ate it with satisfaction. That night, Harima appeared in Saudamini’s dream, revealing that she had come disguised as the girl and urged her to continue the puja with whatever means available, ensuring its survival.

### Worship and Rituals

The Harima Puja is characterized by its simplicity and accessibility. Offerings include banana stems from the garden, and the traditional animal sacrifice was replaced with the offering of bottle gourd (*chal kumro*). This shift reflects the puja’s adaptation to the community’s circumstances while maintaining devotion to Harima.

A notable incident further solidified the puja’s continuation. When Manimala, a later caretaker, planned to skip the puja due to lack of resources, a potter arrived to craft the idol, claiming a middle-aged woman had instructed him to do so. Manimala, realizing this was Harima’s divine intervention, resolved to ensure the puja’s continuity, which persists to this day.

### Cultural Significance

The Harima Puja exemplifies how divine intervention and community resilience can sustain religious traditions. The deity’s appearance as a young girl and the shift to simpler offerings highlight the puja’s emphasis on devotion over material grandeur, making it a cherished tradition in Katwa.

## Putkuni Masi Puja

### Origins and History

The **Putkuni Masi Puja** is centered in the Madan Pahar region of Jharkhand, where the deity Putkuni Masi is revered as a tantric, wish-fulfilling goddess. The puja’s origins are tied to Birju, a tantric practitioner from the region, who lived a life marked by misfortune, including the loss of his mother during childbirth. In a dream, Birju was visited by a figure with a pitch-black face, three blood-red eyes, matted gray hair, sharp teeth, and a third eye on her forehead. Identifying herself as Putkuni Masi, she instructed Birju to find her idol near a large stone at the base of an *akanda* tree in the dense forest at the foot of Madan Pahar.

Following her guidance, Birju located the idol, described as having a long, black face, three blood-red eyes, gray hair, and sharp teeth. He retrieved and established it for worship, initiating the Putkuni Masi Puja.

### Worship and Rituals

The idol of Putkuni Masi is housed in a cave at the foot of Madan Pahar throughout the year, except during the four days of Durga Puja, when it is brought out for worship. On Ekadashi, the idol is returned to the cave. Additional worship occurs on the first day of Magh, Dol Purnima, and Rath Yatra, when the local priest offers prayers at the cave.

During the puja, the idol is placed on a platform (*than*) adorned with flattened rice (*chire*), cane jaggery, milk, and flowers. Young devotees offer white lotuses to express their wishes. If a wish is fulfilled, devotees return the following year with two white lotuses smeared with a few drops of their own blood, which are placed before the idol as an offering.

### Cultural Significance

Putkuni Masi is revered as a powerful tantric deity in the Madan Pahar region, embodying both awe-inspiring and fearsome attributes. The puja’s rituals, rooted in tantric practices, reflect the region’s spiritual traditions and the belief in the deity’s ability to grant wealth, prosperity, and love. The annual worship and the cave’s role as a sacred site underscore the puja’s deep connection to the landscape and culture of Jharkhand.
