# Ras Chakra and Madanmohan Worship in Cooch Behar


The **Ras Chakra** and **Madanmohan worship** are central to the religious and cultural identity of Cooch Behar, West Bengal, particularly through the historic **Ras Mela** festival. The worship of **Madanmohan Thakur**, a Radha-less form of Lord Krishna, reflects the *Ekeshwarvad* (monotheistic) philosophy, emphasizing devotion to Krishna as the sole deity. The Ras Chakra, a towering structure adorned with divine imagery, and the Ras Mela, a vibrant festival, are integral to Cooch Behar’s heritage, blending royal patronage, mythological traditions, and modern festivities.

#### Historical Background
##### Establishment of Madanmohan Worship
During the reign of King **Naranarayan** in the Kamata Kingdom (16th century), Saint **Shankaradev** introduced the *Ekeshwarvad* philosophy, advocating exclusive devotion to Lord Krishna. Despite opposition from royal court scholars, Naranarayan’s brother, **Shukladhwaj** (Bir Chilarai), supported Shankaradev. Impressed by Shankaradev’s exposition, Naranarayan endorsed the construction of a temple for Radha-less Krishna worship, installing the deity **Lakshminarayan**. According to Harendranarayan Chaudhuri’s records, King **Prananarayan** later established the **Madanmohan** idol in the palace’s Madanmohan Thakurbari, with priests like Deenanath Dharmadhakshya, Jibesh Sharma, and Purandar Sharma overseeing rituals, and Harikesh Srimantadev and Kalinath Sharma preparing offerings. By the late century, King **Rupnarayan** installed a new idol, worshipped as **Madanmohan Dev**, marking the beginning of the Ras Mela in the early 19th century.

##### Evolution of the Ras Mela
The Ras Mela began as a three-day festival on Ras Purnima but was extended to eight and then ten days to accommodate visitors. During King **Harendranarayan**’s reign, disturbances attributed to spirits forced the capital’s relocation to Bhetaguri in 1812, where the Ras Mela was held near the Madanmohan Temple. Under King **Rajrajendranarayan**, a cholera outbreak led to the fair’s relocation to the Parade Ground, now known as the “Ras Mela Ground.” In 1922, King **Jitendranarayan** banned gambling, and in 1923, the fair was canceled due to cholera. Electricity was introduced in 1928, enhancing the fair’s appeal. The royal administration ensured security, healthcare, and drinking water facilities, with red-capped police overseeing the event.

Transportation challenges were addressed with a narrow-gauge railway in 1894 from Torsa River to Gitaldaha Ghat, extended to Alipurduar by 1900 and upgraded to a meter-gauge line by 1910. The Cooch Behar State Transport, established in 1945, further improved access. The fair’s duration was extended to fifteen days, as it remains today.

#### Rituals and Practices
##### Madanmohan Thakurbari
The **Madanmohan Thakurbari**, established in 1889 under Maharaja **Nripendranarayan**, is the epicenter of Radha-less Krishna worship. The Ras Mela, initiated on May 4, 1890, features:
- **Ras Chakra**: A 30-foot-tall structure adorned with images of deities and Krishna’s forms, framed on paper with a spire and bamboo poles for rotation, resembling Tibetan Buddhist Kalachakras and Muharram’s taziyas. Crafted by artist Altab Miya’s family for generations, devotees rotate the Ras Chakra to earn merit.
- **Mythological Displays**: Temporary structures (*do-chala ghar*) house idols depicting scenes from Krishna’s life, including a prominent depiction of Krishna slaying the demoness **Putana**, with a large Putana statue and infant Krishna suckling at her breast.
- **Sorna Pratha**: During the royal era, men were barred from the temple on Thursdays from noon to 4 PM, allowing only women to enter, a practice no longer observed.

##### Ras Mela
The Ras Mela, held at the Parade Ground and Stadium, features:
- **Cultural Programs**: Theatrical performances (*yatra*), scripture recitations, and folk song sessions, historically attended by royalty.
- **Stalls and Attractions**: Traders from Rajasthan, Agra, Kashmir, Kolkata, Krishnanagar, and Bhutan sell goods like Dhaka’s Jamdani sarees, Krishnanagar’s clay dolls, and terracotta items. Food stalls offer Pashkura’s chops, Bhetaguri’s jalebis, and steamed pithas. Attractions include Ferris wheels, rides, death wells, and circuses.
- **Historical Practices**: Earlier fairs featured clay dolls at the temple gate and Baul performances, with artisans from Krishnanagar showcasing clay figures.

#### Putana Worship
A unique tradition in Fulbari Bata’s Adhikari family, known as “Rakshasa Bari” (Demon House), involves worshipping the demoness **Putana** alongside Balabhadra, Radha-Gobinda, Jagannath, and Subhadra. According to mythology, Kansa sent Putana to kill infant Krishna with poisoned milk, but Krishna sucked out her life instead. Gaur Adhikari’s grandfather received a divine command in a dream to initiate Putana’s worship, which has continued for four generations. The Putana idol, with long hair, large teeth, and glowing eyes, depicts infant Krishna suckling at her breast. This rare worship of an *Apadevata* (minor deity) alongside major deities is a remarkable example of syncretism.

#### Administrative Changes
In 1907, the Ras Mela’s organization was transferred to the Town Committee, and in 1946, to the Gaur Sabha, reflecting shifts from royal to civic management.

#### Cultural Significance
The Ras Chakra and Madanmohan worship embody Cooch Behar’s rich religious and cultural heritage. The *Ekeshwarvad* philosophy, supported by royal patronage, underscores devotion to Krishna as the sole deity, distinguishing it from Radha-Krishna worship. The Ras Mela, with its vibrant displays, cultural programs, and diverse stalls, bridges ancient traditions with modern festivities. The inclusion of Putana worship highlights the region’s ability to integrate mythological antagonists into devotional practices, creating a unique syncretic tradition.
