# Petkati Durga

**Petkati Durga** (Bengali: পেটকাটি দুর্গা) is a distinctive regional manifestation of the Hindu goddess **Durga**, worshipped primarily in **Gadaipur village**, Raghunathganj, Murshidabad, and **Maynaguri**, Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal, India. The deity is renowned for her unique iconography, characterized by a **visibly cut or hollowed-out belly**, from which her name *Petkati* (literally, “belly-cut”) is derived. Associated with myths of consuming humans, particularly children, Petkati Durga embodies a fierce, Tantric form of the goddess, blending Hindu and Buddhist influences from Bengal’s historical religious landscape. Her worship reflects a syncretic tradition, distinct from other Durga Pujas in the region, such as the **Boro Debi** and **Kathamiya Durga Puja** of Cooch Behar.

## Etymology

The name *Petkati Durga* originates from the Bengali term *petkati*, meaning “cut belly,” referring to the goddess’s idol, which is crafted with a visibly cleaved or hollowed-out abdomen. This feature is central to her mythology, particularly in Gadaipur, where stories describe the retrieval of a human child from the idol’s stomach. In Maynaguri, she is also known as **Petkati Chamunda** or **Chortika**, with her skeletal, emaciated form emphasizing hunger or asceticism, sometimes linked to the Sanskrit term **Kshutkshama** (“the ever-hungry one”).

## Iconography

Petkati Durga’s iconography deviates significantly from the conventional depiction of Durga, such as that seen in Cooch Behar’s **Kathamiya Durga Puja**:

- **Gadaipur**: The idol features a **cleaved belly**, symbolizing the myth of a child being retrieved from the goddess’s stomach. Unlike the traditional Durga with her four children (Ganesha, Kartik, Lakshmi, and Saraswati), Petkati Durga’s form emphasizes her fearsome, devouring aspect. Her appearance aligns with the traditional ten-armed Durga, wielding weapons to slay the demon Mahishasura, but the hollowed belly sets her apart.
- **Maynaguri (Petkati Chamunda)**: The idol is depicted with **eight arms** and a **skeletal, emaciated body**, with a sunken chest and belly suggesting extreme hunger or Tantric asceticism. She is seated on a throne, with one leg bent and the other outstretched over a subordinate figure, often interpreted as **Shiva**, indicating a syncretic blend with **Kali**. A **scorpion-shaped mark** on her belly reinforces her association with insatiable hunger, and her form is linked to the Tantric goddess **Chamunda**.

This contrasts with Cooch Behar’s **Boro Debi**, who has a deep red complexion and is flanked by Jaya and Vijaya, or **Kathamiya Durga**, which adheres to the conventional Durga iconography with her four children.

## Mythology and Legends

### Gadaipur

The worship of Petkati Durga in Gadaipur is steeped in a dramatic legend dating back over a century. During a Durga Puja celebration, a young girl disappeared amidst the festival crowd. Her parents, unable to find her, were devastated. That night, the girl’s father received a divine vision in which Durga appeared, confessing to having devoured the child. She instructed him to come to the temple the next morning and cut open her idol’s belly to retrieve his daughter. Following this command, the father found the child alive inside the idol’s stomach, cementing the goddess’s reputation as a **human-devouring deity**. This event gave rise to the tradition of crafting the idol with a cleaved belly, symbolizing the miraculous retrieval.

Another version of the legend attributes the puja’s origin to **Khudiram Ray** from Malda, who established it approximately 400 years ago. In this account, a young girl (or daughter-in-law) from his household vanished while lighting lamps in the temple at twilight. A dream revelation led the family to find a piece of her clothing caught at the idol’s lips, and the girl was subsequently retrieved by cutting open the idol’s belly. While some narratives associate Petkati Durga with ancient **human sacrifice** practices, no historical evidence supports this claim.

### Maynaguri

In Maynaguri, Petkati Durga is worshipped as **Petkati Chamunda** or **Chortika**, embodying a fierce, Tantric form. Local belief holds that her skeletal appearance and scorpion-shaped belly mark reflect her unquenchable hunger, capable of devouring demons (*asuras*) or, in some myths, humans. Her association with **Kshutkshama** underscores her role as a destroyer of evil, aligning her with Tantric deities like **Chinnamasta** and **Chamunda**.

## Historical and Tantric Context

The Petkati Durga/Chamunda idol in Maynaguri is believed to date back to the **Pala period** (8th–12th centuries CE), a time when Bengal was a hub of **Tantric Buddhism** and **Hindu Tantra**. The Pala and early Sena periods saw the proliferation of fierce goddess cults, influenced by both Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Deities like **Marichi** (Buddhist) and **Surya** (Hindu) shared iconographic and ritualistic elements, and Petkati Chamunda’s skeletal form and eight arms bear stylistic similarities to Tantric Buddhist sculptures from this era.

The division of Tantra into **Hindu Tantra** and **Buddhist Vajrayana**, which originated in Bengal (particularly Barisal), fostered syncretic goddess worship across Eastern India, including Bengal, Assam, Kalinga, and parts of Bihar. Petkati Durga’s imagery—her hollowed belly, fearsome demeanor, and association with hunger—reflects this Tantric milieu, positioning her as both a protective mother and a destructive force against evil.

In contrast, Cooch Behar’s **Boro Debi Puja**, established in the 16th century by King Naranarayan, also incorporates non-Brahmanical elements but focuses on a syncretic Hindu tradition, with Jaya and Vijaya as attendants and dual mounts (tiger and lion). The **Kathamiya Durga Puja**, started in 1889, adheres to mainstream Hindu iconography and rituals, lacking the Tantric intensity of Petkati Durga.

## Ritual Practices

### Gadaipur

The Petkati Durga Puja in Gadaipur begins on **Jitashtami**, earlier than the standard Durga Puja timeline (Mahalaya to Dashami). Key rituals include:
- **Clay Collection**: Clay for the idol is sourced from the **Akhira River**, considered sacred due to its proximity to the worship site.
- **Idol Construction**: Local potters craft the idol with a **cleaved belly**, a symbolic nod to the myth of retrieving a child from the goddess’s stomach.
- **Puja Rituals**: The puja follows traditional Durga Puja practices but emphasizes the deity’s unique mythology, with offerings and rituals reinforcing her fearsome yet protective nature.

### Maynaguri

In Maynaguri, the worship of **Petkati Chamunda** is deeply Tantric, with rituals emphasizing her fierce and ascetic aspects. Specific practices are less documented but likely involve offerings suited to her role as a destroyer of demons, possibly including traditional Tantric elements like mantra recitation and symbolic sacrifices.

### Comparison with Cooch Behar Pujas

Unlike the **Boro Debi Puja**, which incorporates both Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical rituals (e.g., yupa installation, buffalo and magur fish sacrifices), or the **Kathamiya Durga Puja**, which follows conventional Durga Puja rituals (e.g., Aparajita Puja, continuous yajna fire), Petkati Durga’s worship is marked by its early start on Jitashtami and its focus on the goddess’s hunger-driven mythology. The absence of documented animal sacrifices in Gadaipur’s Petkati Puja distinguishes it from the sacrificial traditions of Boro Debi (e.g., buffalo, pig, magur fish) and Kathamiya Durga (e.g., goat, magur fish).

## Cultural Significance

Petkati Durga represents a unique facet of Bengal’s religious landscape, blending Hindu goddess worship with Tantric and folk elements. Her myths of devouring humans, particularly children, evoke awe and fear, positioning her as a deity who transcends the benevolent mother archetype of traditional Durga. The cleaved belly of her idol serves as a powerful visual reminder of her miraculous and fearsome nature, distinguishing her from the more standardized depictions in Cooch Behar’s pujas.

The worship of Petkati Durga in Gadaipur and Maynaguri highlights the diversity of Durga Puja traditions in West Bengal, reflecting local histories, myths, and artistic expressions. While Cooch Behar’s **Boro Debi** and **Kathamiya Durga** emphasize royal patronage and syncretic or mainstream Hindu practices, Petkati Durga’s Tantric roots and human-devouring lore connect her to Bengal’s ancient goddess cults, making her a subject of interest for scholars of religion, anthropology, and art history.

## Temples and Sites

- **Gadaipur, Murshidabad**: The primary site of Petkati Durga worship, where the temple houses the idol with a cleaved belly. The puja is a significant community event, drawing devotees to the Akhira River region.
- **Maynaguri, Jalpaiguri**: The Petkati Chamunda idol, with its skeletal form and Tantric iconography, is worshipped in a temple reflecting Pala-era influences.
