# **Rankini Devi**

**Rankini Devi** (also known as **Kankali Devi**) is a regional folk goddess venerated in parts of eastern India, especially in **Jharkhand**, **West Bengal**, and **Odisha**. Her cult is deeply rooted in tribal traditions, particularly among the **Bhumij**, **Munda**, and other indigenous communities. Rankini is often considered a fierce, protective goddess associated with blood sacrifice, transformation, and royal legitimacy.


## **Etymology and Origins**

Rankini is believed to be a later form of **Kankali**, the *kuladevi* (clan goddess) of the **Singh royal family** of **Dharanagari**. The term “Kankali” may relate to skeletal or fierce imagery associated with goddesses like **Kali**, while “Rankini” appears to be a localized name transformation that occurred after a pivotal mythological event.


## **Mythological Account**

According to local legends, both King **Birbar Singh** of Dharanagari and his royal priest **Ramdev Ojha** had the same dream in which they saw the goddess Kankali commanding them to rescue her from a cave and install her in their palace temple. Obeying the vision, Birbar Singh did so and initiated her worship.

Birbar Singh’s sons, **Prithvi Singh** and **Jagaddeo Pramar**, would later play important roles in the expansion of the cult. While Prithvi Singh inherited the throne, Jagaddeo Pramar left the kingdom and, following divine guidance received in a dream, conquered the fragmented region of **Dhalbhum**. He adopted the name **Jagannath Dhabal Dev**, incorporating both the regional name and a reference to the deity Jagannath.


## **Legend of the Journey and Transformation**

Before establishing his rule, Jagannath Dhabal Dev requested Kankali Devi to accompany him to his new capital. The goddess agreed on one condition: she would follow him, but he must not look back during the journey. However, at a place under a **mahua tree**, startled by a strange sound, the king turned back and saw the goddess. Having broken the vow, the goddess refused to move any further. She declared that she would remain there and changed her name to **Rankini**.

The place where this event occurred came to be known as **Mahulia**, and the wider region, including **Ghatshila** and **Dhalbhum**, is referred to as **Rankinibhumi**.

A poetic version of this legend is preserved in the writings of **Gopendrakrishna Basu**, where the goddess says:

> “From now on, my name shall be Rankini.
> Go, O king, to your capital.”


## **Folk Beliefs and Alternate Legends**

Several variations of Rankini's myth have circulated across tribal regions:

### Bloodthirsty Goddess

A popular tale from **Dain Tikri** village (near **Lalgarh**) portrays Rankini as a **blood-drinking goddess** who resided in a now-abandoned temple. Locals believe that daily sacrifices were offered, and those who brought offerings were often found dead the next day. A clever cowherd once tricked the goddess by offering lime instead of yogurt and iron pellets instead of peas, causing her to flee the temple.

The temple—made of Makra stone with a cracked roof—is said to have been the goddess’s escape route.

### Association with Pir Lohani

In another story, Rankini sought refuge from a Sufi saint named **Pir Lohani** by hiding in a washerman’s house. After escaping detection, she revealed herself to the washerman and made him king. This is believed by some to be the origin of the name **Dhalbhum**, derived from *dhopa* (washerman) or *Dhabal*.


## **Rituals and Worship**

Rankini Devi is worshipped in several forms:

* In **Mahulia**, **Ghatshila**, and **Tamar**, she is venerated as a **protective clan goddess**, sometimes associated with **Kali**.
* Rituals often involve **blood sacrifice**, particularly **red or black chickens**, and are typically conducted without Brahmin priests.
* In some regions, she is worshipped through **tribal dance and song**, and offerings include **liquor**, **rice**, and **livestock**.
* **Women are generally excluded** from participating in certain Rankini rituals, especially those involving sacrifice.


## **Historical Interpretation**

Some scholars believe that Rankini may have originally been a **historical or tribal woman**, later **deified** or **demonized** depending on cultural perspective. In the writings of **Rameshwar Bhattacharya**, Rankini is described as having devoured "sixteen shepherds," highlighting her fearsome persona.

In another account by **Adhar Chandra Ghatak**, **King Kalyan Ray** of **Gumaigarh**, following a dream, founded a new capital at **Maljethia** and began offering **human blood sacrifices** to Rankini. Unable to procure a victim once, he is said to have **offered himself** in devotion.


## **Cultural Significance**

Rankini Devi embodies the **complexity of folk deities** in South Asia—where divine, historical, and folkloric threads often intertwine. For tribal communities in Jharkhand and West Bengal, she remains a potent symbol of **ancestral power, female divinity, and resistance against mainstream Brahmanical deities** like Durga and Kali.
