# Our Activities

## Folklore Research
We gather oral stories through fieldwork and digitize traditional folktale collections. By leveraging this expansive folklore database, Otibeguni is developing cutting-edge machine learning tools to automate the translation of folktales and detect recurring motifs and themes across stories.

## Product Development
We revitalize traditional Bengali folktales for the social media era by translating medieval Bengali poetry into modern, reader-friendly language and creating engaging multimedia content, including audio shows and web comics inspired by these tales. Additionally, Otibeguni designs board and card games based on characters and mythical creatures from Bengali folklore. Its flagship publication, *Mythical Creatures of Bengal*, showcases over 100 supernatural beings from Bengali and indigenous folklore, brought to life with exquisite illustrations.

## Community Engagement
We believe that true cultural revival requires active community involvement. Otibeguni organizes and funds art and writing contests that invite participants to reinterpret and creatively engage with characters and themes from folklore. Our contests have a growing and enthusiastic base of participants from both Bangladesh and abroad, contributing to a vibrant and evolving folklore landscape
