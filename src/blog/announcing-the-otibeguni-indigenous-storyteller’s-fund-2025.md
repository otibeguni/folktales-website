We are thrilled to announce the launch of the Otibeguni Indigenous Storyteller’s Fund 2025 — a BDT 50,000 initiative dedicated to supporting indigenous authors, artists, researchers, and technologists as they bring their ideas to life.

Whether you want to document forgotten folktales, translate ancient songs, produce a Marma-language short film, design an online archive, or create a community podcast, this fund is here to help you tell your story, your way.

## 🌱 What This Fund Offers

This fund isn’t just about financial support. At Otibeguni, we understand that turning an idea into reality often requires mentorship, guidance, and networks. That’s why, along with funding, we provide:

* 1:1 proposal support → We’ll help refine your idea into a solid, actionable plan
* Creative & technical guidance → From writing and editing to digital tools and artwork
* Professional mentorship → Access to our extended network of experts and collaborators
* Visibility & impact → We’ll help connect your work to wider audiences, both locally and internationally

We want to work alongside you, not just as funders, but as partners invested in your success.

## 🟦 Four Dedicated Funding Categories

The total BDT 50,000 fund has been broken into four clear categories, with exactly one project selected from each:

* 🟦 Folklore & Translation - Flexible Budget (outside the 50K pool)
* 🟨 Music & Live Theater - BDT 15,000
* 🩷 Art & Crafts - BDT 15,000
* 🟪 Documentary / Short Film - BDT 20,000

Important notes:

* Folklore & Translation projects have a flexible budget, meaning we’ll support one strong project even if it requires funding beyond the main 50K pool.
* If your project exceeds the allocated budget for its category, you must explain how you’ll secure the remaining funding.
* Demonstrating additional funding sources will make your proposal stronger and more likely to be approved.
* Projects in indigenous languages are highly encouraged, but proposals with translations or supplementary material in Bengali or English will be given extra consideration.
* Live performances, theater, and festivals are welcome — but projects that also create digital content for long-term preservation and access will be prioritized.

## 📝 Inspiration From Draft Ideas

We’ve already received exciting draft ideas from across many indigenous communities and creative fields. Examples include:

* Mro Folklore Collection (Folklore & Translation)
* Garo Traditional Music Composition (Music & Live Theater)
* Tripura Folk-Art Exhibit (Art & Crafts)
* Documentary on the Shatkhira Munda Community (Documentary / Short Film)
* Marma Folk Theater Documentation (Music & Live Theater)
* Rakhine Folklore Collection (Folklore & Translation)
* Hajong Folk-Art Exhibit (Art & Crafts)
* Marma Horror Short Film (Documentary / Short Film)
* Chakma Religious Text Translation (Folklore & Translation)
* Chakma Podcast Development (Cross-Media Storytelling)

These examples show the range and diversity of projects we’re looking to support. Your idea could be next!

## ✍️ What to Include in Your Proposal

Don’t worry if you’ve never written a proposal before — we’ll guide you through it. Your plan doesn’t need to be complicated. It just needs to clearly explain what, why, where, when, who, and how.

Here’s a simple structure to follow:

1. What → What are you making? (Book, short film, archive, podcast, etc.)
2. Why → Why does this matter for your community, culture, or audience?
3. Where → Where will the project happen? (Single village, multiple locations, or online)
4. When → Your estimated start and end dates. Short projects (completed within 3 months) are preferred.
5. Who → Who’s on your team and what are their roles?
6. How much → A simple budget breakdown showing how funds will be spent.

Example: If you’re documenting Rakhine folktales with a budget of 20,000 Taka, ideally 10–15K should go toward collecting, recording, and preserving stories — not just buying equipment.

Your proposal should also highlight how your project ensures originality and authenticity. We want to hear your unique voice and perspective.

## 🎯 Keep It Focused and Actionable

We strongly encourage short, actionable projects that focus on collecting or creating original content.

Examples:

* Good fit: A three-month project to record Marma folk songs with elders, share them digitally, and produce Bengali translations.
* Less likely to be funded: A year-long project needing heavy IT infrastructure with no clear content deliverables.

Why this matters: Shorter projects with clear outcomes are much more likely to receive funding.

## 💸 How the Funding Works

* Total fund: Tk. 50,000, split across three fixed categories
* One flexible project in Folklore & Translation will receive extra funding outside the 50K
* If three projects are selected, we’ll ensure they represent different indigenous cultures
* Partial funding is possible for larger projects, but you must show how the rest will be funded
* Projects in indigenous languages are encouraged, with preference given to those that also produce materials in Bengali or English

## 📅 Key Dates

* Draft idea submission: 15 September 2025
* Detailed proposal submission: 31 October 2025
* Project execution period: 1 November 2025 – 30 April 2026 (6 months)

## 🌊 Submission Process

You don’t need a fully formed proposal to get started.

If you’re unsure where to begin:

* Send us your initial idea by 15 September 2025
* We’ll work with you to shape and refine it
* If needed, we’ll schedule a 1:1 online session to help you plan in detail
