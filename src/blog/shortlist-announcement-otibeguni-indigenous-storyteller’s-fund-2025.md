We are happy to announce the shortlisted projects for the 2025 Otibeguni Indigenous Storytellers Fund. However, we are also deeply concerned by the reports of increasing violence and insecurity facing Indigenous communities across the country. We recognise that in times of crisis, the work of cultural preservation can feel impossible when the urgent needs of personal and community safety are at risk.

In light of this, we are making a small change:

> 💬 Shortlisted applicants can convert their proposal into an emergency relief request. These funds can be redirected to support the essential medical and legal representation costs of fellow community members affected by the recent violence and unrest."

Without further ado, here are the shortlisted projects:

## 🎨 Art & Crafts
- Hill Brushes : Mro culture traditions and stories - Nebai Eung khumi (Green Milieu)
- Jakha Mara: Hajong traditional fishing practices - Newton Hajong
- Ukyanu Artlab - Showcasing Marma Culture - Ukyanu Marma

## 🎭 Music & Live Theater
