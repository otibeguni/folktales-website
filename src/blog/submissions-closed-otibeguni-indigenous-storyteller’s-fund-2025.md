As of September 15, submissions for the 2025 Otibeguni Indigenous Storyteller‚Äôs Fund are now closed‚Äîand we are thrilled to share that we received over 50 proposals! üéâ

Applications came from nearly every major indigenous community in Bangladesh‚Äîfrom Chakma, Marma, Manipuri, Bawm, to Munda storytellers‚Äîand from creators of all kinds: theater artists, filmmakers, anthropologists, and more. We are deeply grateful that so many of you trusted us with your bold, imaginative ideas.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è What Happens Next
- On October 1, we will shortlist 3 projects per category.
- Shortlisted applicants will be invited to submit a detailed proposal by October 31, including execution plans, fixed dates, staffing, and travel itineraries if needed.
- Along the way, we‚Äôll provide actionable feedback to help refine your plans.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è How to Strengthen Your Chances
- Share examples of past work related to your proposal.
- If you are a non-indigenous applicant, include an indigenous co-applicant or cultural consultant.
- Show us the storytelling heart of your project. Purely showcasing artwork or crafts without a narrative focus is unlikely to be funded.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è If You‚Äôre Not Shortlisted
- Don‚Äôt lose hope‚Äîwe‚Äôre committed to supporting your ideas in other ways:
- We will continue digitizing folk-theater scripts and may reach out to collaborate.
- For anthropology-related projects, we‚Äôll connect with institutions to explore future sponsorship opportunities.
- If you proposed a folklore collection project, expect to hear from us soon‚Äîthis is at the very core of our work.

To everyone who applied: thank you once again.
