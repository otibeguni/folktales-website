Rangpur Geetika is a major collection of folk songs and ballads from the Rangpur region of present-day Bangladesh, reflecting the area’s rich oral traditions. The earliest scholarly work on Rangpur’s folklore was done by George Abraham Grierson, who, while serving as a magistrate between 1873 and 1877, collected a ballad titled The Song of Manik Chandra, totaling 701 lines gathered directly from rural peasants. He published the original Bengali text in Devanagari script with an English translation in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1878), marking the first systematic documentation of Rangpur’s oral literature. In modern times, S. M. Samiul Islam, working under the Bangla Academy, has greatly expanded this effort. A native of Rangpur, Samiul Islam traveled extensively across the region, living among local communities to record their songs with authenticity and care. His work reflects not only meticulous collection but also deep curiosity and scholarship, uncovering new and unexplored themes while highlighting Rangpur’s unique cultural identity. Together, these contributions have shaped Rangpur Geetika into a vital archive of northern Bengal’s history, beliefs, and artistic heritage.
