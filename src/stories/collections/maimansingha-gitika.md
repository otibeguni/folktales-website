*Maimansingha Gitika* is a celebrated collection of traditional ballads from the Mymensingh region of present-day Bangladesh. These folk narratives, passed down orally for generations, capture the loves, struggles, and adventures of rural life, blending myth, romance, and heroism with deep cultural roots. Compiled and published in the early 20th century by folklorists like Dinesh Chandra Sen and Chandra Kumar De, the *Gitika* includes legendary tales such as *Mahua*, *Malua*, and *Chandravati*. Together, these ballads offer a vivid window into the beliefs, values, and imagination of the people of eastern Bengal, preserving a rich tradition of storytelling that continues to inspire literature, theater, and music today.
