It was a story from long ago. On the edge of a forest, in a village near the border, a radiant little girl named **Ka Nam** was born, lighting up her parents' home.

Ka Nam was so breathtakingly beautiful that her mother constantly lived in fear — afraid that someone might cast an evil eye on their precious daughter, or worse, steal her away like a princess from a tale. Though Ka Nam’s family wasn’t very wealthy, there was no shortage of love and care showered upon her by her parents.

However, Ka Nam’s father didn’t pay much heed to these worries. He believed that she should grow up like any other child, facing life on her own terms and becoming capable in her own unique way.

The days passed peacefully — until one day, it was as if the mother's fears came true.

Ka Nam was heading to the well with a pitcher to fetch water when a **wicked tiger** from the forest caught sight of her. The tiger immediately wanted Ka Nam for his dinner. But this tiger was far greedier than the others. Instead of devouring her right away, he hatched a far more sinister plan.

He decided to let her grow stronger and more plump, and only then would he feast upon her. Neither Ka Nam nor her family had any idea about the tiger’s cruel scheme.

Day by day, the tiger secretly left food near Ka Nam’s path, helping her grow even more radiant and well-nourished. And thus, Ka Nam blossomed into a young woman of unmatched beauty and grace.

One day, sitting in his cave, the tiger thought to himself:

> "I have waited long enough. No more!
>  
> The time has come to devour Ka Nam.
> 
> She’s grown strong and beautiful, just as I wanted.
>  
> Tomorrow, I’ll gather my fellow tigers, and we shall feast on Ka Nam!
> 
> I can hardly wait any longer!"  
>

Meanwhile, in a corner of the tiger’s cave lived a **kind-hearted little mouse**, who happened to overhear the tiger’s wicked plan. The mouse felt deep sympathy for Ka Nam. But what could a tiny mouse possibly do against such a mighty beast of the jungle?

Still, he couldn’t stand by and do nothing.

Gathering all his courage, the mouse went to Ka Nam, explained everything he had heard, and urged her to seek refuge in the cave of a wizard named **U Hynroh**.

The mouse hoped that with his magical powers, U Hynroh could protect Ka Nam from the tiger.

But alas! Fate had other plans. U Hynroh was no noble wizard at all—he was a **mighty, treacherous toad**, whose very nature was to use trickery and dark magic to harm others.

Upon seeing Ka Nam’s dazzling beauty, U Hynroh too fell under her spell. He decided he wanted to claim her for himself.

Thus, Ka Nam found herself trapped once again—her own beauty becoming her greatest curse. In her once-simple life, the winds of trouble began to stir stronger and stronger, threatening to pull her into yet another storm.

In the name of "protecting" her, the sorcerer gifted Ka Nam a **cloak made of frog skin**. He ordered her to wear it at all times, and under no circumstances reveal her true form to anyone—**or else face death!**

Terrified by this dreadful warning, Ka Nam had no choice. On one side, the hungry tiger; on the other, the cunning sorcerer. She had no escape.

Thus, she obeyed, and as soon as she wore the frog-skin cloak, she was transformed into an **ugly, grotesque frog**. Heartbroken and full of sorrow, she wandered aimlessly through the jungle.

Seeing Ka Nam’s pitiful state, the little mouse was overwhelmed with guilt for sending her into such misery. Determined to make things right, he led Ka Nam to a **magical tree** standing tall in the heart of the jungle.

There, the mouse taught her a powerful, unfailing spell:

> "Rise, O Tree, rise—
> 
> Grow higher, reach the skies.
>  
> Touch the heavens with your crown,
> 
> See how close the stars come down.
> 
> Let no fear bind your flight,
> 
> Grow boldly into the light!"  
>

The tree lifted Ka Nam high, all the way to the **divine Blue Realm of the gods**.

There, everything was breathtakingly beautiful—palaces adorned with shimmering jewels, and everyone dressed in robes woven with pearls and precious stones.

Yet the unfortunate Ka Nam, with her filthy, grotesque frog-like appearance, was met with only scornful glances. No one spared her a second look; their eyes were filled with nothing but contempt.

Even in this wondrous world, Ka Nam wandered sorrowfully under the weight of U Hynroh’s curse. She had no home, no family—her parents left behind, danger lurking at every turn.

One day, while wandering aimlessly, she stumbled near the palace of the **Sun Goddess, Ka Sngi**. Moved by deep compassion, **Ka Sngi** allowed Ka Nam to stay in a small cottage by her grand halls.

Thanks to the goddess’s kindness, Ka Nam's days passed with a little more peace. At night, hidden in solitude, she would dare to remove the cursed frog-skin cloak—for who would see her in the darkness of night?

One day, quite by chance, **Ka Sngi’s son** noticed Ka Nam’s little cottage. Curious, he approached—and inside, he saw a breathtaking young woman asleep. Even in the dim light, her sleeping face seemed to radiate a soft, luminous glow.

Beside her lay the hideous frog-skin cloak, the disguise she wore by day. No heart could remain unmoved by such beauty, and **Ka Sngi’s son** was no exception. He rushed to his mother and declared:

> "I wish to marry her!"  
>

At first, Ka Sngi dismissed her son’s words lightly. But something tugged at her heart. Later that night, she went herself to Ka Nam’s cottage to see the truth.

There she beheld the same wondrous sight. At once, Ka Sngi understood everything. Determined to free this ill-fated maiden from her cruel bondage, the goddess seized the vile frog-skin and hurled it into the **sacred fire**. The cursed cloak burned to ashes, taking with it the last traces of Ka Nam’s suffering.

A **grand wedding** followed, uniting the radiant maiden and the son of Ka Sngi—a true testament to a spirit that again and again rose above the cruelties of fate.

The story could have ended there—with a simple:

> "And so they lived happily ever after."  
>

But the journey of this tale stretched a little farther.

The newlyweds indeed spent their days in peace and joy. Yet old grudges have long shadows.

A bitter enmity had smoldered for ages between the wicked sorcerer **U Hynroh** and the Sun Goddess **Ka Sngi**. And now, the burning of Ka Nam’s cursed frog-skin was like pouring oil onto that ancient fire.

Blazing with rage, U Hynroh abandoned his dark cavern and stormed through the skies toward the radiant Blue Realm—his dark magic aimed at overpowering **Ka Sngi** herself, even dreaming of **swallowing the sun**!

Thus began U Hynroh’s furious assault. But the immense power of **Ka Sngi**, the Sun Goddess, was not so easily challenged.

**Earth’s people**, too, played their part. Seeing the clash in the heavens, they **beat their drums and cymbals**, shouting and singing in celebration against the forces of darkness.

> Hearing this mighty uproar from below, U Hynroh grew frightened.
> 
> He thought the entire world was rising against him!
> 
> Panic-stricken, he faltered—and at last, fled.
>
> Victory belonged to **Ka Sngi**, victory to the **people of Earth**.
> 
> Once again, **light triumphed over darkness**, **goodness over evil**.

However, the blazing fury of U Hynroh has not yet been extinguished. Even today, by the rhythm of the **fortnightly cycle**, he makes his assaults on the borders of the Blue Realm, still harboring the hopeless dream of conquering Ka Sngi. Ages change, centuries flow, but the ancient battle between light and darkness continues to echo through time. Even now, more than once a year, a **dark shadow dares to cover the sun in the sky**. People call it a **"Solar Eclipse."**
