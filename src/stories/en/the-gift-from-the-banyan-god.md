Years ago, an elderly couple welcomed a son late in life. When he grew into a young man, they helped him find a bride, and the couple's happiness brought immense joy to his aging parents.

The young wife was deeply spiritual. Every day, she visited a massive banyan tree near their home, leaving offerings of flowers and fruit at its roots. One morning, as she knelt in prayer, the tree began to shimmer. The God of the Banyan emerged from within the ancient trunk.

"Devoted one," the god's voice resonated like wind through leaves, "what is it you seek?"

The woman bowed low. "I humbly ask for a piece of banyan root."

The god studied her for a long moment before nodding. "I will grant your request, but you must guard this secret with your life. Reveal what I give you, and death will come instantly."

The woman accepted both the root and the terrible condition.

Months passed. Then one terrible night, her mother-in-law fell gravely ill. As the old woman took her final breaths, the young wife ground the banyan root into a paste and rubbed it across her closed eyelids. When she opened her eyes, the world had transformed.

She could see beyond the veil of death itself.

Gods and goddesses descended from the heavens in radiant light. They lifted her mother-in-law's spirit gently onto a golden chariot studded with precious gems and carried her upward. The young wife watched in wonder, tears drying on her cheeks. Her mother-in-law's soul was at peace. There was nothing to mourn.

But fate wasn't finished with her family.

When her father-in-law's time came, she performed the ritual again. This time, her blood ran cold. Twisted, nightmarish creatures materialized around the dying man. They tore at his spirit with clawed hands, dragging him downward as he screamed silently. The young wife watched in horror as they pulled him into the darkness below.

She wept for days.

Her husband couldn't understand. "You didn't cry at all when my mother died," he said, confusion hardening into suspicion. "But now you can't stop. What's going on? Were you... involved with my father somehow?"

"No!" She backed away, shaking her head frantically. "I'm innocent, I swear it. But I can't explain why."

"That's not good enough." His voice grew cold. "Tell me everything."

"I can't."

"Why not?"

"Because I'll die if I do!"

But he wouldn't let it go. He demanded answers, accused her of lying, pushed and pressed until she finally broke.

Through her sobs, she told him everything—the banyan god, the root, the visions of the afterlife. The words had barely left her lips when she collapsed. Dead before she hit the ground.

Panic seized him. With trembling hands, he grabbed the remaining paste and smeared it across his own eyes. He had to know where her soul would go. He had to find her.

He watched her spirit rise from her body, glowing faintly in the darkness. It drifted toward a pregnant cow in a nearby field and tried to enter the unborn calf. The cow's body rejected it violently, and the spirit tumbled away. It tried next with a pregnant goat—again, rejection.

The husband followed desperately as his wife's soul wandered the village, searching for any vessel that would accept her. Finally, impossibly, it slipped into the womb of an elderly woman who lived at the edge of town.

He ran to her door that very night.

"I know this will sound insane," he said breathlessly, "but I need to stay with you. And when your child is born—if it's a daughter—I want to marry her."

The old woman laughed. "I'm past childbearing age, young man. But you seem troubled. You can stay if you need shelter."
Ten months later, against all natural law, the old woman gave birth to a baby girl.

The husband waited. He raised the child like his own, watching for any sign of recognition in her eyes, any hint of the woman he'd loved. When she came of age, he told her everything—the whole impossible truth.

"I know who you are," he said softly. "I know who you were."
And whether she believed him or simply saw the desperate love in his eyes, she agreed to marry him. Life, strange and mysterious as it was, had given them a second chance.

But some say that on quiet nights, when the wind moves through the banyan trees, you can still hear the god's warning echoing: some secrets are meant to stay buried, no matter the cost.
