A king had two daughters. Even though the princesses were supposed to live in the four walls of the castle – but these two princesses were a bit different. Two sisters used to go out of the Rajmahal if they got a chance together. One day we met them with a crow. The crow was bringing a pretty ripe fruit on his lips. The princesses want to eat after seeing the fruit. They said- "Oh what a sweet and toastous fruit! ”

Listening to the princesses, the crow threw the fruit in front of them. Princesses play that fruit. The daughters of the king do not have any shortage of food anymore, if ordered, eight grains will be present. But they have never eaten such fruit in their life, it tastes so good. One fruit does not fill the hearts of two. So they started walking the road the crow came through. If fruit trees are available!

After a long walk, they caught that strange taste fruit tree in front of them. Big sister could climb trees better. He went to Mogdal and put many fruits on the ground by sweeping branches. After that, two sisters left all the worries of the world and came to enjoy the fruit. When they got thirsty for water after eating so much, the elder princess said, "You stay here, I'm bringing water. "That's why she went in search of water. The little one sitting under a tree.

Elder sister tried to bring water by making big leaves of a tree and again, all water was falling down due to the pain of a naughty ghost. Yet she wasn't giving up. Repeatedly taking water from the water. Meanwhile, a foreign king was walking through the forest, his eyes fell on that princess. Then he married her and took her to the kingdom, and the poor little princess lying under a tree.

A herd of Hanuman came and attacked the fruit tree. Someone eats a little fruit, another one throws it. The princess went to the coat of a tree and hide in the fear. From there she saw, everyone attacked the tree except an old monkey. The old monkey didn't have the strength to climb trees, so he is picking up the fruit shells that the other monkeys were thrown away. That old man's eye on the hidden princess. Then he said to others— “Give me some good fruit, or I will not give you the reward I am going to receive.” "The young monkeys laughed at him. But the fruit gave nothing.

When all the monkeys were looted, the old monkey slowly entered the coat of the tree. Then the monkey ate the little princess. After eating, he climbed down the tree, went to the garden of the foreign king. The monkey roamed around in that garden for a while. After a long time a tree was grown there, everyone in the palace got a very tasty fruit.

When the fruit is all over, a yogi singer cut the wood of that tree, made an instrument and started singing in front of the palace. The big princess of our story lives in that palace.

New song came to his head as soon as the singer took that musical instrument in his hand. She started humming—

"Sweet fruit, sweet fruit - my sister.

Where did you go in search of water- Oh my sister.

Two are kings and queens,

Where is the sister, who knows.

After eating me in the monkey,

Where are you, where are you- and my sister. ”

The singer is very happy to sing a new song. That's when the queen came out of the palace to see. Actually after listening to this song, that little sister left behind was singing. Speaking what is in his mind. Watching the musical instrument of the singer made me feel like the queen has to play it anyway. Then he invited the singer to the palace. The night the singer Nemanton went to eat, the queen stole the musical instrument by deceiving. Left a fake musical instrument instead.

Actually that little princess soul lived on that musical instrument. She would come out and bathe, cook neat everyday when nobody was there. He used to keep three parts of the cooking for the kings and queens and eat one portion and then go back into the bazaar.

One day the king has found, let someone cook all the delicious foods every day. And a fresh smell fills the house. One day so she hid, to see what happens.

Then the king saw a beautiful daughter singing and cooking with black long hair after bath. King caught him when he goes back to the bajna after eating himself after cooking.

The nature of a king, it will not be strange to want to marry a younger sister. But the reader can laugh a little thinking about how the family will be with the elder sister and the soul of the younger sister.
